# DakiKobo Data Sources Register

This register tracks source quality before any document enters the RAG corpus.

Only reviewed Markdown under `Data/markdown/` should power the app. Raw research
outputs, scraped pages, or model-generated packs must stay outside the active RAG
path until reviewed.

## Status Labels

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `active_rag` | Already part of the reviewed Markdown/PDF corpus. |
| `candidate` | Good source candidate, but still needs clean extraction/review. |
| `pending` | Needs title/date/publisher/content verification before use. |
| `comparative` | Useful context, but not Burkina-specific. Label clearly if used. |
| `reject` | Do not ingest. |

## Candidate Sources To Extract Carefully

| Status | Date added | Source | Publisher / year | Scope | Topics | License / usage note | Review status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pending_review` | 2026-06-27 | [Catalogue de fiches techniques des mesures d'amélioration de la fertilité des sols](https://www.inter-reseaux.org/wp-content/uploads/Catalogue-AFS-ProSol-04-12-2020.pdf) | ProSol, 2020 | Burkina Faso | fumure organique, compost, parcs améliorés, légumineuses, CES | unknown | reviewed_by_codex_pending_human_review | Extracted to `Data/markdown/prosol_fertilite_sols_burkina_2020.md`; pesticide section excluded and exact microdose table kept out of general RAG advice. Ineligible for RAG until human agronomic review (see `Data/reviews/AGRONOMIST_REVIEW_PACKET_2026-09-12.md`). |
| `pending_review` | 2026-06-27 | [Guide sur la production du niébé en Afrique de l'Ouest](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/items/26504a5f-1844-4773-ad7d-6f86b8bead17) | IITA, copyright 2017, citation 2018 | West Africa | niébé production, varieties, pests, storage | copyright IITA 2017; reuse terms not fully verified | reviewed_by_codex_pending_human_review | Extracted to `Data/markdown/iita_niebe_afrique_ouest_2018.md`; chemical product tables excluded and source kept labeled as regional. Original verified 2026-09-12 (SHA-256 in the review packet); ineligible for RAG until human agronomic review. |
| `quarantined` | 2026-07-03 | [FAO Burkina Faso MAFAP / AGRISurvey / Country Profiles seed batch](https://www.fao.org/in-action/mafap/where-we-work/burkina-faso/en) | FAO, accessed 2026 | Burkina Faso | policy, public expenditure, price incentives, EPA/statistics, country profile | FAO web reuse terms not fully verified | rights_unclear (2026-09-12) | Curated synthesis in `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/fao_burkina_policy_data_profile_2026.md` is explicitly quarantined (`review_status: rights_unclear`): never indexed until FAO reuse terms are confirmed. Quarantine wins over any approval flag. |
| `active_rag` | 2026-07-10 | [MAERAH OAPH 2023-2025 + projets/programmes](https://www.agriculture.bf/offensive-agropastorale-et-halieutique-2023-2025/) | MAERAH Burkina Faso, verified 2026-07-10 | Burkina Faso | national program OAPH, 8 strategic value chains, ministry orientation, public projects list | short public-web orientation summary + URL citation; ministry keeps full page rights | reviewed_by_owner (morawa-dev, 2026-07-10) | Curated synthesis in `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/maerah_oaph_orientation_burkina_2026.md`. OAPH expansion + filières verified vs official page. Sign-off: `Data/reviews/OWNER_SIGNOFF.md`. No fertilizer doses. |
| `active_rag` | 2026-07-10 | [CILSS portail](https://www.cilss.int/) | CILSS, verified 2026-07-10 | Sahel / West Africa | regional resilience, food security institution | short public-web orientation summary + URL citation; CILSS keeps full portal rights | reviewed_by_owner (morawa-dev, 2026-07-10) | Curated synthesis in `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/cilss_orientation_sahel_2026.md`. AGRHYMET/WASCAL still unreachable; not promoted. |
| `candidate` | 2026-06-27 | [ProPulse Légumineuses](https://agritrop.cirad.fr/612314/1/V2COR200225%20PROPULSE%20L%C3%89GUMINEUSES%20.pdf) | CIRAD / partners, PDF created 2025 | Burkina Faso and West Africa | cereal-legume associations, rotations, legumes | unknown | pending_human_review | Useful where the document explicitly supports Burkina sections. Extract cautiously by section. |

## Comparative Or Rejected Sources From Deep Research Audit

| Status | Date added | Source | License / usage note | Review status | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `comparative` | 2026-06-27 | [Fiche de production et de commercialisation du sorgho, Mali](https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agecon/_docs/international-programs/ipim-sahel-french/fiche-technique-sorgo.pdf) | unknown | reviewed_for_rejection | Verified as Mali, March 2011. Do not label as Burkina Faso or 2023. |

Do not label as INERA/FAO/Burkina 2023. |
| `reject` | 2026-06-27 | `Data/_archive/rejected_deep_research_2026-06-27/iaskpro.md` | internal generated output | reviewed_for_rejection | Synthetic guide with only a homepage source URL and unsupported exact claims. |
| `reject` | 2026-06-27 | `Data/_archive/rejected_deep_research_2026-06-27/gemini_deep_res_results.md` | internal generated output | reviewed_for_rejection | Useful themes but wrong dates/publishers/countries and malformed pack. Use audit only, not content. |
| `reject` | 2026-06-27 | `Data/_archive/rejected_deep_research_2026-06-27/deep_research_result_by_chatgpt_dakikobo.md` | internal generated output | reviewed_for_rejection | Off-topic failed run. |
| `reject` | 2026-06-27 | [Scribd FT de l'Arachide](https://fr.scribd.com/document/858694378/FT-de-l-Arachide) | third-party user upload | reviewed_for_rejection | User-upload source with unclear provenance. Find original publisher instead. |

## Ingestion Rules

1. A source must have verified title, publisher, year or explicit `null`, direct URL, and country/region.
2. `West Africa regional` sources can support general advice but must not be presented as Burkina official recommendations.
3. Exact fertilizer doses, pesticide names, crop calendars, and disease treatment advice need source-backed extraction plus human review.
4. Firecrawl output is raw material, not truth. Scraped Markdown must keep URL, crawl date, publisher, and review status.
5. Accepted documents move into `Data/markdown/` only after review.
6. Firecrawl candidates belong in `Data/scraped/pending/`; reviewed promoted copies belong in `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/`.
7. Firecrawl scraping uses `Data/scraped/source_allowlist.csv` by default; unlisted URLs require an explicit `--allow-unlisted` experiment and must not be promoted without review.

## Firecrawl Allowlist And Seed Batch

- Allowlist: `Data/scraped/source_allowlist.csv`
- First seed batch (FAO): `Data/scraped/seed_urls_fao_burkina.txt`
- Expanded trusted seeds (ministry / INERA / WASCAL / AGRHYMET / CILSS):
  `Data/scraped/seed_urls_trusted_bf.txt`
- Allowlist expanded 2026-07-10 for:
  - `agriculture.bf` / `www.agriculture.bf` (ministry)
  - `inera.bf` / `inera.org` patterns
  - WASCAL, AGRHYMET, CILSS climate/agriculture pages
- Scraped pages remain **pending** until human promotion into
  `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/`.
- Allowlist matching treats `https://example.org/*` as also covering the site root
  (`https://example.org` / `https://example.org/`).
- Offline scrape log 2026-07-10:
  - FAO country profile seed → pending Markdown written (review before promote).
  - WASCAL homepage → Firecrawl proxy/site load error (retry later).
  - Use `python scripts/firecrawl_ingest.py --trusted-batch` for the expanded seed list.
- Current seed scope: FAO Burkina Faso MAFAP, FAO AGRISurvey Burkina Faso, and FAO Country Profiles Burkina Faso.
- Local pending outputs generated on 2026-07-02 UTC are ignored by git under `Data/scraped/pending/*.md`.
- Reviewed output promoted on 2026-07-03: `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/fao_burkina_policy_data_profile_2026.md`.
  **Reversed on 2026-09-12:** the synthesis is now quarantined (`review_status: rights_unclear`)
  because FAO web reuse terms remain unverified; it is excluded from RAG.

## Next Source Work

1. Extract verified Burkina sections from CIRAD ProPulse 2025.
2. Search for original official arachide and climate sources to replace weak citations.
3. Confirm FAO web reuse terms; only then may the quarantined FAO synthesis return to review.
4. Use `scripts/firecrawl_ingest.py` only for offline candidate collection, never during user requests.
