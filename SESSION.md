# DakiKobo session log

**Purpose:** Persist decisions and progress across chat resets.  
**Do not** treat chat history as the source of truth for long work.

## How to continue after a context reset

```text
@SESSION.md continue from the last decision and implement the next item
```

Or point at a specific date block:

```text
@SESSION.md implement the first open item under "Next up"
```

After every major step (or end of a 60–90 min session), **append** a new dated entry below (do not rewrite history). Keep bullets short.

## Next up (ordered)

1. **You (async):** collect data using `Data/reviews/DATA_COLLECTION_TASKS.md` (tracks A climate, B photos, C crop names).
2. **When you say “ingest what I collected”:** agent reviews inbox → curated RAG / vision / glossary (no raw auto-promote).
3. **When climate hosts UP (agent):** health probe + refresh for WASCAL/INERA/AGRHYMET.
4. Optional: local agent review of French field phrasing.

## Session entries

### 2026-09-09 — Kiro PR #1 third follow-up review (`5e90fa1d`)

**Verified**

- Reviewed only `4400f37...5e90fa1d` in an isolated worktree. Full suite: 513
  Python tests passed, 1 credentialed live RAG test skipped; 15 JavaScript tests
  passed. Compilation and `git diff --check` passed.
- The deterministic fertilizer demo gate and exact hedged-rouille `/ask` test are
  fixed as requested.
- Do not merge yet: diagnosis classification still requires finite disease
  morphology/vocabulary and misses firm statements such as `feu bactérien`,
  `flétrissement bactérien`, `botrytis`, and `Ce sont des pucerons`.
- Hedged or negated statements such as `C'est peut-être la rouille` and `Le test
  ne confirme pas la rouille` are incorrectly redacted.
- Dose classification exempts an entire sentence when any benign noun appears,
  so `L'urée convient. Appliquez 100 kg/ha pour améliorer le rendement.` and
  `Appliquez 2 g par plant.` reach `/ask`. Units such as tonnes, `%`, `unités
  d'azote`, and `kg N/ha` also remain outside the detector.

**Files changed**

- `SESSION.md` only for this review; the PR/application branch was not edited.

### 2026-09-09 — Webroot and HTTP security hardening prepared

**Changed**

- The Flask web process and maintenance diagnostics now read secrets only from
  exported/server environment variables; automatic `.env` loading was removed.
- Docker sets `APP_ENV=production`; production startup fails closed when
  `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is missing or debug mode is enabled, and session cookies are
  marked Secure.
- `.dockerignore` excludes `.env` variants and runtime/private files. Apache
  `.htaccess` disables directory listings and denies dotfiles, source/config,
  SQLite, logs, and private root directories without blocking public static data.
- All Flask responses receive a restrictive CSP, anti-framing/MIME-sniffing,
  referrer, cross-origin, and permissions headers; production adds HSTS.
- Search indexing is disabled by default with `robots.txt` and `X-Robots-Tag`,
  controlled by `SEARCH_ENGINE_INDEXING_ENABLED`.
- Updated README, deployment guide, implementation plan, project state, agent
  rules, environment template, and security regression tests.

**Verified**

- Full Python suite: 296 passed, 1 credentialed live RAG test skipped.
- JavaScript suite: 13 passed. Dependency check and `git diff --check` passed.
- Current tracked files and reachable Git history showed no `.env` commit and no
  common Groq, Google, OpenAI, or private-key signature match.
- The currently deployed Space returns 404 for `/.env`, `/.git/config`, and
  `/config.py`, but has no `robots.txt` or new browser security headers yet; a
  reviewed commit and deployment are required before those controls are live.

**Not performed**

- No commit, push, merge, deployment, hosting-dashboard change, external scan, or
  live Apache configuration test was performed.

### 2026-09-09 — Kiro PR #1 second follow-up review (`4400f37a`)

**Verified**

- Reviewed only `ba892cb2...4400f37a` in an isolated worktree. Full suite: 482 Python
  tests passed, 1 live RAG test skipped without credentials; 15 JavaScript tests passed.
- The exact adjacent-sentence dose case, named diagnosis cases, and generic-certainty
  false positives reported in the prior review are fixed.
- Do not merge yet: definitive diagnoses using diseases absent from the closed lexicon
  survive through `/ask` (for example ergot and helminthosporiosis).
- The one-sentence dose window is brittle: it falsely removes `20 litres d'eau par pied`
  beside an urea sentence, while `100 kg/ha` survives if one neutral sentence separates
  it from the urea sentence.
- `/examples/fumure_sorgho` still publicly returns exact NPK/urea doses with `Fort`
  confidence while `NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED` is false, contradicting the rule that
  approved figures belong only behind the deterministic fertilizer gate.
- The exact safe phrase `Il s'agit peut-être de la rouille.` lacks the requested
  `redact_unsafe_text` and `/ask` regression coverage, although the current behavior passes.

**Files changed**

- `SESSION.md` only (review log); PR/application branch unchanged.

### 2026-09-09 — Kiro PR #1 follow-up review (`ba892cb2`)

**Verified**

- Follow-up fixes are present for RAG diagnosis filtering, safe vision confirmation,
  quantity chemical-context gating, bounded pesticide matching, and config documentation.
- Branch verification: 453 Python tests passed, 1 live RAG test skipped; 15 JavaScript
  tests passed. Targeted reproductions for the four requested cases passed.
- Remaining merge blockers: generic non-disease phrases are falsely redacted; some
  definitive-diagnosis phrasings survive; and a fertilizer name followed by a dose in
  the next sentence bypasses the per-sentence detector.
- No hard repository-standard violation remains. Non-blocking design concern:
  `core/answer_safety.py` now combines several responsibilities in 578 lines.

**Next suggested fix**

- Make diagnosis detection context-aware, cover additional firm-diagnosis phrasing,
  and preserve chemical context across adjacent sentences when checking a dose.
- Keep live RAG/model evaluation as a pre-deployment gate.

**Files changed**

- `SESSION.md` only (review log); PR/application branch unchanged.

### 2026-09-09 — Review of Kiro PR #1 (`bb4b444b`)

**Verification**

- Reviewed `origin/main...origin/fix/audit-safety-and-cache-identity` on an
  isolated worktree; PR remains open and application branch was not checked out locally.
- Offline branch suite: 401 Python tests passed, 1 live RAG test skipped; 15 JavaScript tests passed.
- Do not merge yet: RAG explicitly disables definitive-diagnosis filtering, and
  Vision passes model-controlled `a_confirmer_par` through without safety review.
- New dose heuristic removes safe irrigation quantities such as `20 litres d'eau
  par pied`; pesticide substring matching treats ordinary `décision` as the trade
  name `Decis` and can replace a safe answer with a refusal.
- New config defaults are not documented in README/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, contrary
  to repository instructions.

**Decision guidance**

- Keep exact fertilizer doses out of model-generated RAG permanently; after
  agronomist approval, expose approved figures only through the deterministic
  fertilizer module. Refine the heuristic instead of weakening that boundary.
- Require Kiro to add regression tests for the four reproduced cases and update
  configuration documentation; run credentialed/live evaluation before deployment.

**Files changed locally**

- `SESSION.md` only (review log); PR/application branch unchanged.

### 2026-09-09 — Exploratory bug audit (no fixes applied)

**Verified**

- Full local regression baseline: 291 Python tests and 13 JavaScript tests passed.
- Vision model output is not schema/safety validated: a list-valued `reponse_courte`
  raises `AttributeError`; model-supplied `Fort` confidence and numeric pesticide
  instructions pass through unchanged.
- Multipart overhead can make `/screen` reject files below the configured/advertised
  file-size limit because Flask's whole-request ceiling equals the file ceiling.
- RAG and browser answer cache identities cover model/corpus/context but not the
  deployed prompt/safety-policy revision, so code-only safety changes may leave old
  answers reusable for up to the cache TTL.
- Source eligibility currently leaves only two active Markdown documents (CILSS and
  MAERAH/OAPH); most crop field-practice material is excluded pending human/agronomist review.
- Generated TTS MP3 files have no runtime cleanup or bounded cache.

**Next suggested fixes**

- First: validate and clamp vision JSON, reject unsafe chemical/dose instructions,
  and add regression tests for malformed/provider-noncompliant output.
- Then: short-circuit empty retrieval before the LLM, return truthful HTTP failure
  statuses, version both server/browser answer caches by safety policy, separate
  multipart request/file limits, and bound TTS storage.

**Files changed**

- `SESSION.md` only (audit log); application code unchanged.

### 2026-07-10 — Chat-first UI (uncrowd interface)

**Decided**

- User report: UI too crowded to chat / upload image flow blocked by panels.
- Default: **collapsed** field context + examples; compact landing (2 lines).
- Chat area gets min-height; examples open as horizontal scroll strip.
- Emoji keyboard in screenshot is OS/browser (not app) — not fixed in code.

**Files changed**

- `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, `static/js/index.js`, tests

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `c09c843a`
- HF: `10dd1f2c`

---

### 2026-07-10 — Persist field context + examples scroll

**Decided**

- Continue code-only while owner collects A/B/C data later.
- Persist parcelle context + Français simple in `localStorage` (device only, no server PII).
- Crop select uses `fr_simple` labels when Français simple is on.
- Examples panel scrolls when many cards; heading notes quota-safe demos.

**Files changed**

- `static/js/index.js`, `static/css/style.css`, `templates/index.html`
- `tests/test_frontend_assets.py`, `SESSION.md`

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `dc73b453`
- HF: deploy after push

---

### 2026-07-10 — Code-only demo polish (CILSS + honest refusal)

**Decided**

- User gathers A/B/C data later via DATA_COLLECTION_TASKS; agent continues **code-only**.
- Add quota-safe demos: **CILSS** (regional, no field rain) and **Hors sujet** (honest refusal, no fake case card).
- README points to collection tasks + SESSION.

**Files changed**

- `core/examples.py`, `templates/index.html`, `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`, `README.md`
- tests, `SESSION.md`

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `d4132257`
- HF: deploy after push

**Next action**

- More code polish, or wait for owner data / climate UP.

---

### 2026-07-10 — Data collection task list for owner

**Decided**

- User will gather climate docs, leaf photos, and local crop names later (online + people).
- All “inputs needed” are organized in `Data/reviews/DATA_COLLECTION_TASKS.md` (tracks A/B/C, inbox paths, done criteria).
- Agent waits for “ingest what I collected” before processing; no invented local names or climate content.

**Files changed**

- `Data/reviews/DATA_COLLECTION_TASKS.md`
- `SESSION.md`

**Next action**

- Owner works through DATA_COLLECTION_TASKS at own pace; agent continues code-only if asked.

---

### 2026-07-10 — UP-only refresh + crop-labels API + vision eval kit

**Decided**

- Preflight refresh: 5/9 UP (MAERAH, CILSS, FAO×3); climate hosts still DOWN.
- Firecrawl refused overwrite of existing pending files — no new promote needed.
- Add `GET /crop-labels` for French crop UI labels (no local-language generation).
- Add `Data/vision_eval/` manifest template for Colab phone-photo runs.

**Files changed**

- `app.py`, `static/js/index.js`, tests
- `Data/vision_eval/*`, `.gitignore` samples
- `SESSION.md`, `notebooks/README.md`

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `98f3c4bd`
- HF: deploy after push

**Next action**

- Climate when UP, or real phone photos for vision, or local crop names.

---

### 2026-07-10 — Owner sign-off MAERAH/CILSS (morawa-dev)

**Decided**

- Owner **morawa-dev** authorized the agent to record sign-off on GitHub identity.
- MAERAH and CILSS curated docs: `review_status` → `reviewed_by_owner`.
- Budget/emploi figures: only as **official published targets**, never field promises.
- Crop local-language labels left open (not part of this sign-off).

**Files changed**

- `Data/reviews/OWNER_SIGNOFF.md`
- `Data/reviews/SOURCE_VERIFICATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`
- `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/maerah_oaph_orientation_burkina_2026.md`
- `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/cilss_orientation_sahel_2026.md`
- `DATA_SOURCES.md`, `TODO.md`, `SESSION.md`, `core/examples.py` (demo card label)

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `af8a066b`
- HF: deploy after push

**Next action**

- Climate scrape when UP, or vision Colab, or crop glossary human fill.

---

### 2026-07-10 — Demo OAPH example + owner sign-off form + notebook 05

**Decided**

- Climate hosts still DOWN — no scrape this pass.
- Add quota-safe **OAPH** demo example (correct expansion, MAERAH source card).
- Align rotation demo answer with azote / IITA-style message.
- Provide **OWNER_SIGNOFF.md** for human checkboxes (not agent-signed).
- Notebook 05 = export criteria only (no model packaging).
- DEMO_SCRIPT covers français simple + OAPH.

**Files changed**

- `core/examples.py`, `templates/index.html`
- `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`
- `Data/reviews/OWNER_SIGNOFF.md`
- `notebooks/05_export_criteria.ipynb`, `notebooks/README.md`
- `SESSION.md`, `TODO.md`, tests

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `bc6ad426` + test fix
- HF Space: `087ffd0f`

**Next action**

- Human owner sign-off, or Colab vision, or climate scrape when UP.

---

### 2026-07-10 — Refresh preflight skip + notebook 04 + crop glossary data

**Decided**

- Owner sign-off still human-only.
- WASCAL/INERA/AGRHYMET still DOWN — no scrape.
- `refresh_trusted_sources.py` now **preflight-probes** and scrapes only UP URLs (unless `--skip-health-check`).
- Notebook 04 scaffold for baseline classifier research (no training hype).
- Crop label glossary JSON: French primary; local-language fields **empty** until native-speaker fill; not wired to LLM generation.

**Files changed**

- `scripts/refresh_trusted_sources.py`, `tests/test_refresh_trusted_sources.py`
- `notebooks/04_baseline_classifier.ipynb`, `notebooks/README.md`
- `Data/glossaries/crop_labels.json`, `Data/glossaries/README.md`, `core/crop_labels.py`, `tests/test_crop_labels.py`
- `Data/scraped/seed_urls_trusted_bf.txt` — comment bare agriculture.bf SSL issue
- `SESSION.md`, `TODO.md`

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `8e7982e2` (feature `fd2a1663`)
- HF Space: `5c1fcfef`

**Next action**

- Owner sign-off, or Colab vision runs, or fill crop glossary with humans.

---

### 2026-07-10 — Trusted health probe + SCOLD Colab wiring

**Decided**

- Owner sign-off still human-only; skipped for agent work.
- WASCAL / INERA / AGRHYMET still **unreachable** (HTTP fail/timeout) — no scrape/promote.
- Pending ministry/FAO scrapes already covered by curated RAG (MAERAH/OAPH, CILSS, FAO profile); no new promote.
- Add lightweight **`scripts/check_trusted_sources.py`** for pre-refresh HTTP probes (cron-friendly, no Firecrawl key required).
- Notebook 03 gets a concrete Colab `embed_image` / HF AutoModel scaffold; production remains Gemini until eval wins.

**Files changed**

- `scripts/check_trusted_sources.py`, `tests/test_check_trusted_sources.py`
- `notebooks/03_scold_retrieval_eval.ipynb`, `notebooks/README.md`
- `.gitignore` — `reports/trusted_source_health.md`
- `SESSION.md`, `TODO.md` (if updated)

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `b6a48959` (feature `5662fdf8`)
- HF Space: `d1ec8c6c`

**Still open**

- Owner MAERAH/CILSS sign-off
- Climate/research sites when network allows
- Real SCOLD run on phone photos in Colab

**Next action**

- Owner sign-off, or re-probe trusted sources later, or phone-photo Colab experiment.

---

### 2026-07-10 — MAERAH/CILSS source verification (next-up #1)

**Decided**

- Agent **source verification** completed for MAERAH/OAPH and CILSS; **owner sign-off** remains required (not claimed as full human approval).
- OAPH facts locked: expansion confirmed on official page; 8 strategic value chains (riz, maïs, pomme de terre, blé, poisson, bétail-viande, volaille, mangue); adopted 30 Aug 2023 per page text.
- License stance: short orientation synthesis + URL citation only; institutions keep full page rights; no bulk republication.
- AGRHYMET / WASCAL / INERA still unreachable (timeout) — do not invent climate/INERA content.
- Audit lives under `Data/reviews/` (not under `Data/markdown/`) so it is **not** RAG-ingested.
- New review_status: `source_verified_pending_owner_signoff` (UI label in `app.py`).

**Files changed**

- `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/maerah_oaph_orientation_burkina_2026.md`
- `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/cilss_orientation_sahel_2026.md`
- `Data/reviews/SOURCE_VERIFICATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`
- `Data/scraped/rejected/_unreachable_20260710_session.md`
- `app.py` — review status labels
- `DATA_SOURCES.md`, `TODO.md`, `SESSION.md`

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub: `9e169448` (verify commit stack `b36b6d6d` + session note)
- HF Space: `8d4ce3b9` (Deploy GitHub main 9e169448)

**Still open**

- Owner checkboxes on MAERAH/CILSS files
- WASCAL / INERA / AGRHYMET when online
- Vision SCOLD encoder; local languages later

**Next action for the following session**

- Implement next open item after owner sign-off, or retry unreachable climate/research sites, or optional pending→curated KB only if high field value.

---

### 2026-07-10 — Field citations, eval gate, French simple, session log

**Decided**

- OAPH = **Offensive Agropastorale et Halieutique 2023-2025** only (never invent “Office des Aménagements…”); source: curated MAERAH md.
- Scrapes stay **offline → pending → human review → promote**; never auto-ingest into RAG.
- **Français simple** is a UI toggle + glossary footnotes (`core/simple_french.py`), not full local-language generation.
- Feedback export is **private evaluation only** (consent); wire via `--feedback-csv` smoke re-asks.
- Trusted refresh is cron-ready (`scripts/refresh_trusted_sources.py`) and **never auto-promotes**.
- Citation policy: demote FEWS/livelihood-style titles on field-practice queries; prefer IITA/ProSol extension manuals; if only weak sources remain, keep one card at **Faible** (do **not** strip all sources—uncited LLM answers failed mil/maladie smoke).
- Retriever `k=6`, score lookup `k=10` to surface extension manuals.
- SoilGrids external 502: smoke allows HTTP 200/502/503; soft source-count when not 200.
- Live gate: hard checks structural; keywords/confidence **advisory**; `--min-pass-rate 0.75`.

**Files changed (major)**

- `core/simple_french.py`, `templates/index.html`, `static/js/index.js`, `static/css/style.css` — Français simple
- `Data/markdown/scraped_reviewed/maerah_oaph_orientation_burkina_2026.md`, `cilss_orientation_sahel_2026.md`
- `Data/markdown/iita_niebe_afrique_ouest_2018.md` — rotation niébé-céréales section
- `Data/markdown/prosol_fertilite_sols_burkina_2020.md` — humidité / CES section
- `app.py` — citation demotion, practice-query ranking, simple-french wiring
- `core/llm_chain.py` — retriever k=6
- `scripts/evaluate_rag.py` — OAPH, rotation, humidité, simple-french cases; soil 502 tolerance; `--feedback-csv`
- `scripts/export_feedback_eval.py`, `scripts/refresh_trusted_sources.py`
- `scripts/vision_eval_helpers.py`, `notebooks/03_scold_retrieval_eval.ipynb`
- `Data/scraped/rejected/*` — WASCAL/INERA tunnel, AGRHYMET 502, CILSS 404
- `README.md` — Space demo story; `TODO.md` / `PROJECT_STATE.md` updates

**Git / deploy (end of day)**

- GitHub `main`: `83144836` (and earlier stack through OAPH/CILSS/simple-french)
- HF Space verified: `ede2e40f` — live eval **14/14 hard-pass** when RAG ready
- Public checks: OAPH correct; rotation → IITA; humidité → ProSol; français simple engrais → “Mots simples”

**Still open**

- Human license/details review for MAERAH + CILSS synthesis
- WASCAL / INERA / AGRHYMET scrapes when Firecrawl/sites healthy
- SCOLD real encoder in Colab; notebooks 4–5 research only
- Mooré / Dioula / Fulfulde not started
- Optional screenshots for Space README

**Do not**

- Promote raw Firecrawl pending pages or error HTML
- Invent fertilizer doses or pesticide product lists in LLM path
- Commit `.env`, `chroma_db/`, `reports/feedback_eval.csv`, private feedback exports
- Rely only on chat history for the next session — update this file instead

### 2026-08-24 — Phase 1: the registry (core/places.py, core/crops.py)

**Decided**

- Executed Phase 1 of the locked spec in `plans/dakikobo_assessment_and_plan.md` — single source of truth for places (20) and crops (10).
- `core/places.py`: `Place` dataclass + `PLACES` dict + `resolve_place` / `list_places`; 6 weather-backed places with coords (ouagadougou, bobo, kaya, ouahigouya, fada, dori), 14 with `has_weather=False`.
- `core/crops.py`: `Crop` dataclass + `CROPS` dict + `resolve_crop` / `list_crops`; `fertilizer_supported=True` only for sorgho, mil, mais, niebe, arachide.
- Rewired consumers onto the registries: `weather.py`, `soil.py`, `query_context.py`, `fertilizer.py` (`_match_crop` via `resolve_crop` + guard), `crop_labels.py`.
- Frontend selects now populated from `GET /registry` with `place.id`/`crop.id` option values; deleted `FIELD_LOCATION_TO_WEATHER`/`FIELD_LOCATION_TO_SOIL`; `syncToolsFromFieldLocation` uses the selected id directly with `option[value=...]` existence guards.
- Sentinel options (`""`, `autre`, `__custom__`) preserved via `.detach()`/re-append; init deferred behind async `/registry` fetch with `.always(initFieldContext)`.
- Note: stored `location_select` values were display labels — after switching to ids they fail to restore and degrade safely to "field unset" via existing existence guard (no state corruption).

**Files changed**

- `core/places.py`, `core/crops.py` — new registries
- `core/weather.py`, `core/soil.py`, `core/query_context.py`, `core/fertilizer.py`, `core/crop_labels.py` — rewired onto registries
- `app.py` — `GET /registry` route
- `static/js/index.js` — `populateRegistrySelects`, direct-id sync, init reordering
- `tests/test_registry.py` — 15 new tests
- `tests/test_app_routes.py`, `tests/test_frontend_assets.py` — (updated where needed)

**Tests**

- Full offline suite: **226 passed** (excludes live-network `tests/test_rag.py`). Only pre-existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.

**Still open**

- Phase 2 (extract retrieval & citation into `core/retrieval.py`) is the next phase in the locked spec.

**Next action for the following session**

- Implement Phase 2 of the locked spec, or run the live RAG smoke test when network is available.

---

### 2026-08-26 — Phase 2: retrieval and citation extraction

**Decided**

- Executed Phase 2 of the locked spec in `plans/dakikobo_assessment_and_plan.md`.
- Moved citation normalization, matching, metadata formatting, weak-source demotion, ranking, and confidence policy from Flask into the network-free `core/retrieval.py` seam.
- Added immutable `SourceCard` / `GroundedAnswer`, stable runtime chunk IDs, query-less score injection, source-card JSON compatibility, and best-effort count-based fallback when score grading fails.
- Rewired `/ask` to perform exactly one scored vector search (`k=6`), retain the configured similarity threshold, and pass the same accepted documents to the LLM combine chain and citation grading.
- The active corpus manifest hash is now set only after a persisted vector store is accepted or a rebuild succeeds, and is cleared before each load/build attempt to prevent stale cache identity.
- Preserved refusal, uncertainty, deterministic fertilizer, French response, and source metadata behavior. Docker/Gunicorn worker settings were intentionally unchanged for Hugging Face compatibility.

**Files changed**

- `core/retrieval.py` — extracted citation policy and Phase 2 public API.
- `app.py` — removed duplicate citation policy, activated manifest hashing, and replaced double retrieval with one scored search.
- `tests/test_retrieval.py` — offline policy coverage for chunk IDs, source metadata, noisy/weak source handling, FEWS demotion, count fallback, and manifest state.
- `tests/test_app_routes.py` — one-search orchestration, exact document handoff, source JSON, and manifest load/rebuild assertions.
- `config.py` — corrected citation-policy code reference.

**Tests**

- Retrieval policy: **10 passed**.
- Route + retrieval target: **74 passed**.
- Full offline suite: **234 passed** (excludes live-network `tests/test_rag.py`). Only the pre-existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- Python compilation and `git diff --check`: passed.
- Public Space pre-deploy check: `/healthz` reports `ready`; `/version` reports `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, multilingual MiniLM embeddings, Markdown KB, startup warm-up enabled, and commit `5374ee13aa82e0cc4deb7ba117cc25756eb7c7a0`.

**Git / deploy**

- Phase 2 remains in the local working tree; no commit, push, or Hugging Face production deployment was performed automatically.
- Existing one-worker Gunicorn deployment contract remains unchanged. Deploy through the documented HF worktree flow after review, then rerun the strict public evaluation.

**Still open**

- Phase 3 (SQLite cache and concurrency migration) is next in the locked spec.
- Post-deploy verification must confirm the new Space commit, `rag_status=ready`, one-search behavior, and strict public RAG evaluation.

**Next action for the following session**

- Review and deploy Phase 2 to the Hugging Face Space, then run `scripts/evaluate_rag.py --strict --min-pass-rate 0.75` against the public URL.

---

### 2026-08-29 — Phase 0/1 audit repairs + Phase 2 deployment verification

**Decided**

- Audited the uncommitted Phase 0/1/2 work against the locked plan instead of trusting the earlier completion notes.
- Phase 0 still contained the live XSS typing path, five-argument photo case call, simple-French elision/footnote loss, stale docs, dead metrics privacy constant, redundant exception tuple, and unlocked readiness reads; all are now repaired.
- Phase 1 now converts registry ids to French labels before prompt/card construction, populates all five selects from `/registry`, preserves the existing accented `/crop-labels` contract, and returns the registry cache header required by §7.16.
- Phase 2 remains one scored top-six vector search per `/ask`; the same threshold-accepted documents ground generation and citation grading, while stable ids retain provenance for all retrieved candidates.
- Kept Docker/Gunicorn at one worker; the plan forbids raising concurrency before Phase 3 moves volatile state to SQLite.

**Files changed**

- `static/js/index.js`, `templates/index.html`, `core/simple_french.py`, `core/ops_metrics.py` — Phase 0 repairs and dynamic registry UI.
- `core/crops.py`, `core/places.py`, `core/query_context.py`, `core/crop_labels.py`, `core/fertilizer.py`, `core/weather.py`, `core/soil.py`, `app.py` — Phase 1 registry and id/label wiring.
- `core/retrieval.py`, `app.py`, `config.py` — Phase 2 extraction, manifest identity, and one-search orchestration.
- `tests/test_frontend_assets.py`, `tests/test_simple_french.py`, `tests/test_registry.py`, `tests/test_query_context.py`, `tests/test_retrieval.py`, `tests/test_app_routes.py` — regression and orchestration coverage.
- `README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — current modules, citation flow, and token default.

**Verification**

- Full offline suite excluding live RAG: **243 passed**, one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- Targeted Phase 0/1/2 suite: **139 passed**.
- Python compilation and Flask import: passed.
- Production Gunicorn smoke: booted with the Docker-compatible one-worker command; `/healthz` returned 200 and `/registry` returned 200 with 10 crops, 20 places, and `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`.
- Local live `tests/test_rag.py`: no test result; stopped after 142 s while `huggingface_hub` was waiting for model assets.
- Current public Space (before this work is pushed): `/healthz` is `ready`; `/version` is commit `5374ee13aa82e0cc4deb7ba117cc25756eb7c7a0`; `/registry` is 404, confirming Phase 1/2 are not deployed yet.

**Git / deploy**

- No commit or push performed. New imported modules are untracked, so deployment must include `core/crops.py`, `core/places.py`, and `core/retrieval.py`; do not use `git commit -am` alone.
- After pushing GitHub and the HF worktree, verify `/registry`, `/version`, `/healthz`, then run `scripts/evaluate_rag.py --strict --min-pass-rate 0.75`.

**Still open**

- The plan demands 20 places but the pre-registry alias table had only 17 unique labels; the existing Phase 1 draft fills the locked count with Réo, Boromo, and Yako. Obtain product-owner confirmation before changing that vocabulary.
- Phase 3 is next; do not change worker count before its SQLite cache/state migration.

### 2026-08-30 — Phase 2 live deployment completed

**Decided**

- Kept the Phase 2 retrieval architecture and repaired the final public-evaluation regression by expanding the reviewed OAPH acronym only in the retrieval query.
- The expansion uses the verified MAERAH meaning, while the original farmer question remains unchanged for display and answer generation.

**Files changed**

- `core/query_context.py` — add the reviewed OAPH retrieval expansion.
- `tests/test_query_context.py` — protect the expansion with a regression test.

**Verification**

- Full offline suite: **244 passed**, with one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- Public `/version`: commit `2dd12b4866346a49d75a9075d05a390744961409`, `rag_status=ready`.
- Public `/registry`: 10 crops and 20 places.
- Strict public RAG evaluation: **14/14 hard-passed (100%)**; the OAPH case passed with HTTP 200, medium confidence, and one grounded source. Five advisory warnings remain non-blocking.

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub feature commit: `cfe791432b159d17e3cc832c9a21a9d339a33885`.
- Hugging Face Space deploy: `2dd12b4866346a49d75a9075d05a390744961409`.

**Still open**

- Phase 3 is next; keep the production worker count at one until the SQLite state migration is complete.

**Next action for the following session**

- Begin Phase 3 from `plans/dakikobo_assessment_and_plan.md` when requested.

---

### 2026-08-30 — Phase 3 cache and concurrency deployed

**Decided**

- Moved answer, weather, soil, and privacy-safe ops state to one WAL-enabled SQLite database with a 30-second busy timeout.
- Answer-cache keys include the normalized resolved retrieval query, canonical crop/place ids, growth stage, Français simple flag, LLM model, and active corpus-manifest hash.
- Cache hits bypass intent routing, Groq, retrieval, weather enrichment, and TTS while preserving the grounded answer, case, sources, confidence, and top-six chunk provenance.
- Raised production serving to two Gunicorn workers × four threads with a 90-second timeout only after shared-state tests passed.
- The first live two-worker deploy exposed a Chroma `collections_tmp` migration race. Added a kernel file lock around vector-store initialization so one worker builds and the other loads the completed store.
- Pruned unused direct dependencies and pinned NumPy 1.26.4, Torch 2.2.2, and Transformers 4.57.6.

**Files changed**

- `core/cache.py`, `core/answer_cache.py`, `core/ops_metrics.py` — shared SQLite cache/metrics boundary, stable answer keys, salted question hash, bounded cross-worker metrics, and Chroma startup lock.
- `core/weather.py`, `core/soil.py`, `core/case_log.py` — persistent TTL caches and once-per-process case-log initialization.
- `app.py`, `config.py`, `Dockerfile`, `Procfile` — `/ask` cache fast path, cache-hit metrics, environment defaults, and concurrent serving.
- `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, `README.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — dependency, runtime-state, deployment, and operator documentation.
- `tests/test_cache.py`, `tests/test_answer_cache.py`, `tests/test_ops_metrics.py` and route/weather/soil tests — Phase 3 regression and concurrency coverage.

**Verification**

- Full offline suite excluding the separate live `tests/test_rag.py`: **261 passed**, one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- Two-worker local Gunicorn smoke: both gthread workers booted; 24 concurrent `/healthz` calls produced one shared ops snapshot with 24 events and coherent p50/p95 values.
- Public `/version`: deploy `40e92d546d651568edf9f0bb83bc3a409a691081`, answer cache enabled, RAG ready.
- Twelve alternating public `/healthz` samples reached both workers; both reported `ready` with no Chroma error and distinct successful warm-up completion timestamps.
- Live repeated OAPH request: first HTTP 200 in 2.49 s; subsequent HTTP 200 responses in 0.46 s. Ops recorded `rag/cache_hit=false` followed by two `cache/cache_hit=true` events with 1.52 ms and 4.01 ms server latency.
- Public weather and soil responses reported `cached=true`; ops metrics were shared and queryable.
- Strict public RAG evaluation: **14/14 hard-passed (100%)**, with two non-blocking advisory warnings.

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub Phase 3: `6348f69b` plus Chroma concurrency fix `b6d4d70b`.
- Hugging Face Space: `40e92d546d651568edf9f0bb83bc3a409a691081`.

**Still open**

- Phase 4 (field journal and evidence ledger) is next in the locked plan.
- Free-Space cold warm-up remains CPU-bound at roughly four minutes; once warm, two workers remain ready and repeat answers use the shared cache.

**Next action for the following session**

- Begin Phase 4 from `plans/dakikobo_assessment_and_plan.md` when requested.

---

### 2026-08-31 — Phase 4 field journal and evidence ledger implemented

**Decided**

- Migrated the field journal additively to schema v4 with canonical crop/place ids, the answer
  path (`rag`, `fertilizer`, `vision`, `cache`), and a seven-day follow-up deadline.
- Added a privacy-safe evidence ledger: every top-six chunk receives its exact score, kept/dropped
  decision, and `weak_title`, `low_overlap`, or `score_margin` reason under the existing salted
  question hash. Question and answer text never enter this ledger.
- `/ask` writes the evidence batch best-effort; `/feedback` links it atomically using the salted
  hash plus exact batch timestamp. Cache hits clone the original decision batch without another
  retrieval or Groq call.
- Added a privacy-minimized `GET /journal/due` digest, plus evidence decisions in private CSV/JSONL
  feedback exports.
- Extracted `core/case_contract.py` beneath the case builder and demo examples, moved demo case
  metadata into declarative profiles, and removed the late-import/per-id workaround from B9.

**Files changed**

- `core/case_log.py`, `core/retrieval.py`, `core/case_contract.py` — schema v4, journal/ledger APIs,
  exact retrieval decisions, cache-hit evidence cloning, and shared field-case contract.
- `app.py`, `static/js/index.js`, `config.py`, `.env.example` — two-step response/feedback linkage,
  answer-path and registry-id propagation, due route, schema visibility, and follow-up default.
- `scripts/export_feedback_eval.py` — outcome rows joined to privacy-safe chunk decisions.
- `tests/fixtures/retrieval_golden.json`, `tests/test_evidence_ledger.py`, and case-log/cache/route/export
  tests — offline golden decisions, migration, privacy, linkage, best-effort, due-digest, and export
  coverage.
- `README.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Phase 4 operator and product docs.

**Verification**

- Full offline suite: **268 passed**, one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- Phase 4-focused suite after test isolation: **91 passed**.
- Python compilation, dependency check, and `git diff --check`: passed. Node.js is not installed in
  the local environment, so standalone `node --check` was unavailable; frontend wiring remains
  covered by the asset and Flask integration tests.
- Two-worker Gunicorn smoke: both gthread workers booted; 24 concurrent `/feedback` writes returned
  HTTP 200 with 24 unique ids and exactly 24 shared rows. The database reported `journal_mode=wal`,
  `user_version=4`, and `/version` reported field-journal schema 4.
- Public `/version`: deploy `6995460f5adf57816a7754df52de45f2de021144`, field-journal schema
  4, answer cache enabled, and RAG ready after the expected roughly four-minute CPU warm-up.
- Public `/journal/due`: HTTP 200 with `Cache-Control: no-store` and a privacy-minimized empty digest.
- Live repeated OAPH request: first HTTP 200 via `answer_path=rag` in 3.04 s with a ledger reference;
  second HTTP 200 via `answer_path=cache` in 0.56 s with a distinct cloned ledger reference.
- Strict public RAG evaluation: **14/14 hard-passed (100%)**, with five non-blocking advisory warnings.

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub Phase 4: `124e19c82f127c01b12cb3e007386301968e951e`.
- Hugging Face Space: `6995460f5adf57816a7754df52de45f2de021144`.

**Still open**

- Phase 5 (offline-first shell) is next in the locked plan.

**Next action for the following session**

- Begin Phase 5 (offline-first shell) from the locked plan when requested.

---

### 2026-08-31 — Phase 5 offline-first PWA implemented

**Decided**

- Added a root-scoped service worker and Web App Manifest. The app shell, registry, crop labels,
  quota-safe examples, images, and deterministic fertilizer data are precached after the first
  connected load.
- `/ask` is network-first. Successful responses are saved under a normalized request key and replayed
  when the same question is asked offline. Supported fertilizer questions use the fixed local table;
  uncached questions fail honestly in French instead of inventing advice.
- Split reusable rendering into `static/js/render.js` and HTTP requests into `static/js/api.js`, while
  retaining field context, short follow-ups, photo context, and existing event order in `index.js`.
- Added the exact offline banner: `Mode hors ligne — dernières réponses enregistrées`.

**Files changed**

- `static/sw.js`, `static/manifest.webmanifest`, `static/data/fertilizer.json` — PWA shell, cached
  answers, and zero-LLM offline fertilizer path.
- `static/js/render.js`, `static/js/api.js`, `static/js/index.js`, `templates/index.html`,
  `static/css/style.css`, `app.py` — frontend modules, offline UI, root worker route, and registration.
- `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tests/js/frontend.test.js`, `tests/test_phase5_offline.py`, and
  frontend asset tests — jsdom runner, safety regressions, PWA wiring, and authoritative table parity.
- `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — dependency ignores and final Phase 5 docs.

**Verification**

- JavaScript suite: **3 passed** (`node --test` + jsdom).
- Full offline Python suite excluding the separate live RAG test: **270 passed**, one existing PyPDF2
  deprecation warning.
- Browser test with the local Flask server stopped after first load: offline banner appeared and
  `Dose d'engrais pour le sorgho` returned the fixed NPK/urée advice, sources, Fort confidence, and
  mandatory local-agent confirmation entirely from the service worker cache.
- Node syntax checks and `git diff --check`: passed.
- Public `/version`: deploy `3a3ade584f9c5882c5aa62e19cf703b0cc7ea76f`, RAG ready after the
  expected background warm-up. Public manifest, root-scoped worker header, offline banner, frontend
  modules, and deterministic fertilizer response were all verified live.

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub Phase 5 feature commit: `180c47140a3ae41c52e51999a9ca2a5d0fbea71a`.
- Hugging Face Space: `3a3ade584f9c5882c5aa62e19cf703b0cc7ea76f`.

**Still open**

- No implementation phases remain in the locked Phase 0–5 plan.

---

### 2026-08-31 — Final Phase 0–5 audit and hardening

**Fixed**

- Replaced internal exception details in public API errors with stable French messages while keeping
  diagnostic detail in server logs.
- Made the Python fertilizer rules the single source for the offline JSON asset, including every
  canonical crop alias and fertilizer keyword.
- Kept all browser writes in the API module and all presentation work in the render module.
- Restricted service-worker caching to the explicit public shell so weather, health, version,
  operations, and private journal routes cannot return stale cached data.
- Tied cached answers to the exact evidence-ledger batch that produced them, including normalized
  question variants, so feedback never links to a newer unrelated batch.
- Removed the online-only font dependency and added best-effort caching for the remaining public icon
  assets.
- Kept `/healthz` and `/version` responsive during the multi-minute RAG warm-up by making the
  published-chain readiness sentinel a lock-free read.

**Verification**

- Independent standards and Phase 0–5 specification reviews: no remaining confirmed issue.
- Full offline Python suite: **275 passed**, with only the existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- JavaScript suite: **6 passed**, including real service-worker install, fetch, online-save, and
  offline-replay behavior.
- Real browser with the Flask server stopped: `Quel engrais pour le petit mil ?` produced the mil
  fertilizer card, sources, confidence, and mandatory confirmation entirely offline.
- Python compilation, JavaScript syntax, dependency integrity, generated-data parity, and
  `git diff --check`: passed.
- Live `/healthz` and `/version` returned HTTP 200 in under one second while correctly reporting
  `warming`, then `/healthz` reported `ready` after the two-worker CPU warm-up completed.
- Strict public RAG evaluation: **14/14 hard-passed (100%)**, with five non-blocking advisory warnings.

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub audited code: `571d182876c0cb8ff93f8c21f961c2ed00bbb82e`.
- Hugging Face Space: `f2ef78280d493e2f08bfd8054b4252324d7301cd`.
- No implementation phases or confirmed audit issues remain.

---

### 2026-09-06 — New farmer-focused assessment and plan (review only)

**Scope and decision**

- Owner requested a fresh project assessment and a new Markdown plan before any implementation.
- Added `plans/FARMER_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2026-09-06.md` as a draft for owner review; previous Phase 0–5 plan remains historical.
- No application code, configuration, corpus, dependencies or deployment changed. Pre-existing untracked `.agents/`, `.gitattributes` and `skills-lock.json` left untouched.

**Findings**

- Prioritized journal ownership, online/offline crop parity, cached-advice freshness, conversation reset, ingestion eligibility, exact fertilizer provenance and stronger semantic evaluation.
- Reproduced offline mismatch: selected sorgho plus a question explicitly asking for maize fertilizer returns sorgho.
- Proposed simpler farmer task entry, accessible concise answers, durable private follow-up and a farmer/extension-agent pilot, with dependencies and acceptance gates.

**Verification**

- Current offline Python suite: **275 passed**, one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning, 93.11 seconds.
- Current JavaScript suite: **6 passed** using the bundled Node runtime.
- Public health probe failed DNS resolution in this environment; no current production availability or live model-quality claim made.
- No new agronomist review, real-phone usability study or visual browser audit performed.

**Next action**

- Wait for owner review and explicit authorization of the new plan or a selected phase before implementation.

---

### 2026-09-07 — Farmer-safety implementation resumed and locally verified

**Decided**

- Continued the owner-authorized September 6 improvement work already present in the interrupted
  worktree; preserved all prior changes and made only a targeted offline-install resilience fix.
- Treat the implementation as a local engineering baseline, not field validation or deployment.
- Keep release blocked until expert source/dose review, real-phone checks, the farmer/extension-agent
  pilot, production persistence confirmation, and live RAG evaluation after the stricter source rebuild.

**Implemented**

- Journal schema v5: anonymous browser ownership, explicit consent, 90-day retention, idempotence,
  owned read/outcome/delete operations, re-encoded follow-up photos, and research-export consent.
- Offline/cache safety: crop precedence parity, ambiguous/unsupported refusal, 24-hour and corpus
  invalidation, dynamic-answer exclusion, clear-chat memory reset, and graceful missing-table refusal.
- Evidence/product baseline: fail-closed source eligibility, no startup web ingestion, source audit,
  restricted fertilizer provenance claims, stronger mandatory evaluation contracts, 60-case draft
  scorecard, farmer task starters, default simple French, immediate rendering, transcript review,
  image resizing, local jQuery, shared budgets, and complete PR gates.
- Updated `.env.example`, `README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and the September 6 plan to match the
  implemented configuration and remaining external gates.

**Verification**

- Offline Python suite: **288 passed**, one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- JavaScript suite: **12 passed** with the bundled Node runtime.
- Python compilation, `git diff --check`, generated fertilizer/source-audit stability: passed.
- Blank human scorecard correctly failed; no evaluation result was fabricated.
- Isolated local runtime: `/healthz`, `/version`, `/sw.js`, journal session, save, and owned read passed;
  schema v5 and root service-worker headers were reported correctly.

**Next action**

- Review the worktree, then commit if desired. Do not deploy until the blocked evidence and live
  post-rebuild checks above are deliberately accepted or completed.

---

### 2026-09-07 — Offline crop clarification completed

**Decided**

- Continued the next safe code-only gap from the farmer improvement plan while leaving agronomist-only
  source promotion and fertilizer provenance decisions untouched.
- Treat ambiguous, unsupported, and unresolved fertilizer crop context as a clarification request,
  not as permission to reuse a stale selected crop and not as a generic connectivity failure.

**Implemented**

- `static/sw.js` now returns explicit French offline clarification responses for multiple named crops,
  recognized unsupported crops, and fertilizer follow-ups whose crop cannot be resolved safely.
- Clarification responses contain no fertilizer case or dose. Missing offline data and non-fertilizer
  requests still fall through to the existing honest generic reconnect response.
- Updated the existing service-worker tests in `tests/js/frontend.test.js` to cover these responses and
  preserve explicit-current-question precedence over an old selected crop.

**Verification**

- Static inspection confirmed all three clarification branches return `clarification_required: true`,
  no `case`, and no numeric guidance; supported explicit crops still select the current question crop.
- The IDE command runner hung before producing test output for both the JavaScript suite and targeted
  Python checks, including retries with absolute Node and Python paths. Automated pass counts are
  therefore not claimed in this entry. Run the commands below in a normal terminal before commit:
  `/Users/albarka/.nvm/versions/node/v24.20.0/bin/node --test tests/js/frontend.test.js` and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_frontend_assets.py tests/test_answer_cache.py`.

**Next action**

- Review and commit the accumulated worktree if the local commands pass. Keep deployment blocked on
  agronomist provenance review, approved corpus inventory, post-rebuild live RAG checks, production
  persistence checks, and the real-phone farmer pilot.

---

### 2026-09-07 — Farmer improvement validation completed

**Validated**

- Targeted frontend/cache Python checks: **21 passed** in 3.80 seconds, with the existing PyPDF2
  deprecation warning.
- Service-worker-focused JavaScript checks: **9 passed**; complete JavaScript suite: **13 passed** in
  1.84 seconds.
- Full offline Python suite: **289 passed** in 9.35 seconds, with the existing PyPDF2 deprecation
  warning.
- Live synthetic RAG smoke: **1 passed** in 17.49 seconds. It used the test's synthetic crop documents
  and did not rebuild or validate the project corpus. One upstream LangChain/Pydantic deprecation
  warning was reported.
- `scripts/export_offline_fertilizer.py` and `scripts/audit_source_eligibility.py` reproduced their
  current outputs byte-for-byte. Python compilation and `git diff --check` passed.
- The earlier apparent command hangs were a Kiro interactive-PTY completion-detection issue. Managed
  execution confirmed that Node and pytest exited normally; no test-harness correction was needed.

**Status**

- The safe local engineering validation gate is complete. No commit or deployment was performed.
- Deployment/pilot readiness is still blocked by work that cannot be truthfully automated here:
  agronomist approval of exact fertilizer provenance and intended corpus sources, approved benchmark
  expectations, production secret/database/image persistence checks, real-phone accessibility and
  offline-update checks, participant comprehension sessions, and a post-approval corpus rebuild plus
  live deployed RAG evaluation.
- The current fail-closed source inventory remains intentionally narrow. Do not self-promote sources or
  rebuild/deploy it merely to increase coverage before the documented expert review.

---

### 2026-09-08 — Farmer-safety baseline published and deployed

**Decision**

- The owner explicitly authorized synchronizing GitHub and the live Hugging Face Space after the
  remaining agronomist, production-persistence, device, and participant evidence gates were explained.
- Published the validated engineering baseline without promoting pending sources or adding private
  runtime data. Pre-existing untracked `.agents/`, `.gitattributes`, and `skills-lock.json` remained
  outside the GitHub commit.

**Git / deploy**

- GitHub implementation commit: `327adbd66a19ed0bc61fd0b3e9551a84767c4e0e`
  (`Implement farmer safety improvements`).
- Hugging Face deployment commit: `5b8f2d4f10cf4c7e9a9eefaf42310d7070751256`.
- User-level Git LFS initialization succeeded. The earlier attempted system-wide installation failed
  harmlessly because the user cannot write `/etc/gitconfig`; hooks remained enabled for pushes.

**Production verification**

- Public `/version` reported deployment `5b8f2d4f10cf4c7e9a9eefaf42310d7070751256`, field-journal
  schema **5**, the expected Groq/embedding models, and `rag_status=ready`.
- Public `/healthz` returned `ok=true`, `rag_ready=true`, and a completed warm-up.
- Strict public RAG evaluation: **14/14 hard-passed (100%)**, no mandatory safety failure and no
  advisory failure. Three non-blocking `source_terms` warnings remained for niébé storage, compost/
  soil, and niébé rotation.

**Still open**

- Deployment does not substitute for agronomist provenance approval, approved benchmark expectations,
  real-phone accessibility/offline-update checks, participant comprehension sessions, or explicit
  verification that the production secret, journal database, and images survive host replacement.
- The fail-closed corpus remains intentionally narrow; do not promote pending sources merely to widen
  coverage.

### 2026-09-08 — Release review safety correction prepared

**Review and decisions**

- Confirmed GitHub `main` at `c23f13e0798bcf3945b7ab90afb912c39d305bc4` and the Hugging Face
  Space at `5ec73978890aa2cbf0aff11483e98bfa1b53d995` before making changes.
- A standards/spec review found that unverified numeric fertilizer guidance was still publicly
  enabled despite the F6 release gate. Exact doses are now withheld online and offline until
  agronomist provenance approval; explicit multi-crop questions ask for clarification.
- Rating-only feedback no longer requires consent to save full question/answer text. Journal retention
  and capacity are configurable. The duplicated Markdown frontmatter parser was consolidated.
- Phase D offline journal write/retry and complete visible version/freshness presentation remain open;
  the plan now says so explicitly.

**Verification before publication**

- Full offline Python suite: **290 passed**, with the existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- JavaScript suite: **13 passed**. Python compilation, generated fertilizer asset stability, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

**Next action**

- Commit and push the reviewed correction to GitHub, deploy that exact GitHub tree to Hugging Face,
  then verify remote versions, health, safety behavior, and the strict public evaluation.

**Published verification**

- GitHub correction commit: `95ba47e56dab17ece18dbc316d2d8d6e86ce202d`
  (`Enforce farmer safety review gates`).
- Hugging Face deployment commit: `270c542f1f7947f1b47364748c454bc791770146`
  (`Deploy GitHub main 95ba47e5 to Space`).
- Public `/version` reported the Hugging Face commit above; `/healthz` returned `ok=true`,
  `rag_ready=true`, and `rag_status=ready`.
- Live fertilizer checks withheld an exact sorghum dose with `confidence=Faible`, no sources/case,
  and asked for clarification when sorghum and maize were both named.
- Strict public evaluation: **14/14 hard-passed (100%)**. Three non-blocking advisory warnings remain.

### 2026-09-09 — Verified audit findings repaired (vision validation, cache identity, statuses, storage bounds)

**Scope**

- Fixed the eight verified code findings from the audit review. No corpus, review status, or
  eligibility record was touched: `git diff main -- Data/` is empty and
  `NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED` stays `False`. Source approval remains a separate human/agronomist task.
- Branch `fix/audit-safety-and-cache-identity`; all user-facing strings remain French.

**Root causes and fixes**

- **Vision payload trust.** `core/disease.py` called `.get` on whatever `json.loads` returned, so a
  bare JSON list/string/number raised `AttributeError` out of a function documented as never raising;
  list fields were joined without type checks; `niveau_de_confiance` reached the farmer verbatim, so
  the model could self-report `Fort`. New `core/answer_safety.py` normalises every field and caps
  vision confidence at `Moyen` (`clamp_vision_confidence`), applied again in `app._confidence_for_screen`.
- **Unenforced advice ban.** The prompts forbade pesticide names and exact doses, but nothing checked
  the output. `redact_unsafe_text` drops offending sentences (products, chemical doses, definitive
  diagnoses), appends a French notice, and substitutes a deterministic refusal when nothing safe
  survives. Applied to vision and, for products/doses only, to the grounded RAG answer. The
  non-diagnosis disclaimer and agent-confirmation line are appended unconditionally.
- **Safety-blind cache identity.** A safety deployment changes no document and no model name, so both
  cache keys were unchanged by it. `safety_policy_revision()` (declared version + digest of
  `answer_safety`/`disease`/`fertilizer`/`llm_chain` source) now enters the server key, the `/sw.js`
  asset digest, and a new `X-DakiKobo-Safety` header checked against a `/__safety__` marker in `sw.js`.
- **Cache ahead of the safety route.** The lookup ran before intent classification, so a pre-gate
  cached answer could still serve an exact dose. Demonstrated with a regression test: on `main` the
  planted entry `Appliquez 100 kg/ha de NPK 14-23-14 au semis.` was returned. Classification now runs
  first and `_answer_cache_usable` excludes safety-routed questions from **both** reads and writes.
- **Ungrounded generation.** `/ask` always ran the combine chain, then discarded its answer when no
  document cleared the threshold. Zero accepted documents now returns the deterministic French refusal
  before any Groq call.
- **Failures reported as success.** `/ask` returned 200 on chain failure and `/screen` returned 200 for
  unconfigured/unreachable/quota/upstream errors. `screen_leaf_image` now returns a `service_status`
  mapped to 503/502/429; the French JSON body shape is unchanged. An unclear photo stays 200.
- **Multipart ceiling.** `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` equalled the advertised per-file limit, so a 5 Mo photo
  plus boundary markers and field-context fields was rejected with 413. Added
  `MULTIPART_OVERHEAD_BYTES` (512 KiB) on top of the transport ceiling; per-file checks unchanged.
- **Unbounded audio.** Random MP3 names meant every repeat wrote a new file forever. Filenames now
  hash the spoken text (reused without re-synthesis), writes are atomic via temp + rename, and
  `prune_audio_cache` bounds the directory by TTL then by least-recently-used size.

**Verification**

- Complete Python suite: **401 passed, 1 skipped** (`tests/test_rag.py` skips itself: no `GROQ_API_KEY`
  in this environment). Was 290 before; 111 tests added. One pre-existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning.
- Complete JavaScript suite: **15 passed** (`npm run test:js`), up from 13.
- Every new regression test was confirmed to **fail against the unmodified sources** (reverted file by
  file): 15 in `test_disease.py`, 20 across `test_app_routes.py`/`test_answer_cache.py`, 8 in
  `test_tts.py`, 2 in `frontend.test.js`. The vision crash reproduced as
  `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'`.
- Guardrail discrimination checked on 30 hand-written French sentences: 14/14 unsafe caught, 16/16 safe
  advice untouched — including the mandatory disclaimer, yields (`1 200 kg/ha`), seed rates, and row
  spacing.
- `compileall`, `node --check`, `git diff --check` passed. `scripts/export_offline_fertilizer.py`
  reproduced `static/data/fertilizer.json` byte-for-byte.

**Not done / still open**

- No deployment. No live Space verification and no strict public RAG evaluation were run: this
  environment has no `GROQ_API_KEY` and no Space access, so no live model-quality claim is made.
- The pesticide list and dose patterns are heuristics. They are conservative by design but need an
  agronomist to confirm the vocabulary, and a French reviewer to confirm the redaction wording reads
  well to a farmer.
- Redacting doses from grounded RAG answers matches the current F6 gate. It must be revisited when an
  agronomist approves exact provenance, or approved figures will be suppressed too.
- All previously blocked gates remain blocked: agronomist provenance approval, approved corpus
  inventory, production persistence checks, real-phone accessibility, and participant sessions.

**Next action**

- Review the PR. Before any deploy, run the strict public evaluation with real credentials and confirm
  `/screen` and `/ask` status codes against the live Space.


### 2026-09-09 — HTML improvement plan for another executor

- Reviewed current working tree at HEAD `17e11922`, existing plans, source policy, key response paths and CI; preserved all existing changes.
- Created `plans/DAKIKOBO_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2026-09-09.html`: ten prioritized tickets, dependencies, effort, acceptance criteria, validation gates and handoff prompt. Application code unchanged.
- Fresh verification: 296 Python tests passed with `tests/test_rag.py` excluded; one PyPDF2 warning. JavaScript suite unavailable because npm/node were not on PATH. Local policy inventory confirms two eligible documents. HTML structure and section links checked.
- No live provider/deployment or farmer pilot checks performed. Next executor should reconcile pending branch fixes, then follow the plan; human source review and pilot remain prerequisites.


### 2026-09-09 — Improvement plan started: local baseline reconciliation

- Completed Ticket 01 baseline identification without overwriting existing work.
- Fetched origin: main is `40bb8a85`; safety PR and offline follow-up PR are merged.
  Local main remains `17e11922` with all pre-existing changes preserved.
- Independently checked origin/main in an isolated temporary worktree: 626 Python
  tests and 20 JavaScript tests passed. Local: 296 Python and 13 JavaScript passed.
  Real RAG test explicitly excluded; one PyPDF2 warning per Python run.
- Offline fertilizer export unchanged; git diff --check passed.
- Changes this pass: PROJECT_STATE.md, this log, and
  plans/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_2026-09-09.md. No application behavior changed.
- Remote reconciliation claims are not blanket acceptance: missing/empty cache
  identity, interrupted audio writes, concurrency and expired replay still need
  explicit acceptance checks. Source matrix and synthetic recovery drill remain
  actionable preparation; human source approval and phone pilot remain open.
- Next: integrate remote baseline with existing local hardening without losing
  work, verify the combined state, then cover remaining acceptance criteria.
- No commit, push, deployment, real provider call or human sign-off performed.


### 2026-09-09 — Plan integration and offline policy identity regression

- Fast-forwarded local main from 17e11922 to 40bb8a85 and restored local work.
  Backup stash named codex-plan-integration-20260909 remains available.
- Resolved SESSION by retaining both histories and app.py by retaining both
  production Secure cookies and the multipart overhead ceiling. No merge commit
  was needed: conflicts were from stash restoration after a fast-forward.
- Combined offline Python suite: 632 passed, one PyPDF2 warning; real RAG excluded.
- Reproduced missing/empty/whitespace offline policy identity and legacy empty
  marker replay: all four tests failed before the fix (200 instead of 503).
- static/sw.js now requires nonempty safety identity for storage and replay.
  JavaScript suite: 24 passed. Existing successful-cache fixtures now include
  the policy header sent by the current server.
- Offline fertilizer export unchanged; git diff --check passed.
- Updated README, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, PROJECT_STATE and dated plan status.
- Next: complete browser migration acceptance, audio interruption/concurrency
  checks and source-matrix preparation. Human approval and pilot remain open.
- No new commit, push, deployment or live provider call; local edits unstaged.


### 2026-09-09 — Plan audio cleanup, worker activation and source matrix

- Ticket 06: reproduced abandoned partial-file leakage and symlink traversal in
  cleanup. Added TTS_PARTIAL_TTL_SECONDS (default 3600 seconds), pruning only old
  generated partial files whose POSIX advisory lock is available. Synthesis holds
  that lock through atomic rename. Cleanup skips symlinks and non-regular MP3s.
- Tests cover abandoned/recent/unrelated files, external symlink targets and a
  paused writer concurrent with cleanup. Full offline Python suite: 635 passed,
  one PyPDF2 warning; real RAG test excluded.
- Ticket 03: shared-cache worker activation regression confirms removal of the
  previous version's answers, then offline refusal. JavaScript: 25 passed.
  This is a simulated worker lifecycle, not real-phone/browser acceptance.
- Ticket 05: created Data/reviews/CROP_COVERAGE_MATRIX_2026-09-09.md with 20 cells,
  candidate excerpts, declared zones and explicit missing PDF pages/approval.
  Checked 20 cells and that ProSol/IITA candidates remain ineligible. No corpus
  mutation, ingestion or benchmark changes; no agronomic approval invented.
- Updated config, rag_pipeline, TTS/JS tests, README and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN;
  updated this log, PROJECT_STATE and dated plan status.
- Remaining: user-visible handling of expired audio replay, wider concurrent MP3
  eviction checks, real-browser lifecycle test, original-page source verification,
  agronomist review, isolated backup/recovery drill and field pilot.
- No commit, push, deployment or real provider call. MP3 cap preserves the current
  file and excludes active/recent partials; it is not a hard total-disk quota.


### 2026-09-09 — Replay recovery and isolated journal restore

- Ticket 06: reproduced silent expired-audio failure through real index.js and
  render.js in jsdom. Replay now shows a French role=status message, retains the
  answer, clears failed playback state and allows retry. Both rejected play()
  and media error events are tested, including a subsequent successful retry.
- Ticket 07: tests/test_recovery.py creates two synthetic consented text cases,
  uses fresh Flask processes with a stable synthetic production secret, carries
  the owner cookie across restart and restore, and denies another client.
  SQLite backup API and integrity check, isolated restore, deletion and expiry
  passed; original database and backup still contain their original two rows.
- Rehearsal uses Flask test clients, no live HTTP listener or device browser.
  No real journal, photos, hosting volume or provider was touched. Original
  photo-path preservation and actual host durability remain release checks.
- Fresh full offline suite: 636 Python passed, one PyPDF2 warning, 57.98 seconds;
  credentialed RAG test excluded. JavaScript: 27 passed. Offline fertilizer export
  unchanged; git diff --check passed.
- Files: static/js/index.js, static/css/style.css, tests/js/audio.test.js,
  tests/test_recovery.py; README, DEPLOYMENT, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, PROJECT_STATE,
  dated status report and this log. Existing changes preserved.
- DEPLOYMENT now documents private durable paths, stable session secret,
  WAL-consistent backups, photo path caveat, retention reconciliation and rollback.
- Next: photo backup/restore drill, concurrent MP3 budget checks, real-browser
  validation, source original-page verification and agronomist/pilot evidence.
- No new commit, push, deployment or live model call.

### 2026-09-12 — Photo restore, concurrent audio and Chromium acceptance

- Restored a consistent synthetic journal plus two JPEG attachments at the same
  isolated mount path. References remained readable; a second client could not
  see or delete them. Owner deletion and expiry removed restored photos while the
  original mount and backup snapshot stayed unchanged.
- Concurrent TTS checks: four same-answer writers exposed one complete MP3; twelve
  distinct writers converged to the configured soft limit after a quiescent prune,
  with no partial files left.
- Headless Chromium acceptance at 320 and 1280 px: expired-audio recovery visible,
  answer text preserved, no horizontal overflow and no page errors. Artifacts are
  under reports/browser_replay_check. This is not a physical-phone/user pilot.
- Full-suite verification exposed a timezone-boundary weather defect: Casablanca
  had crossed midnight while Burkina/provider data had not. The rainfall windows
  used the system's Burkina date rather than the provider observation date, shifting
  the fixture by one day. Added a red regression and anchored windows to the provider
  date with Burkina time as fallback.
- No live provider call, deployment, commit, push, agronomic approval or field pilot.
- Fresh final verification: 640 offline Python tests passed with one PyPDF2
  warning; credentialed RAG excluded. All 27 JavaScript tests passed. Modified
  Python files compiled, offline fertilizer export was unchanged, and diff check
  passed.

### 2026-09-12 — Ticket 05 original-source page verification

- Downloaded the current CGIAR-hosted IITA cowpea guide (67 PDF pages) and the
  Inter-réseaux ProSol catalogue (77 PDF pages) into the ignored review workspace.
  Recorded SHA-256 identities in both local Markdown source summaries.
- Extracted every page and visually inspected IITA PDF pages 12, 29, 34, 60 and
  61 plus ProSol pages 6, 9 and 10. Added physical and printed page references to
  the 20-cell crop coverage matrix.
- IITA candidates I1, I2 and I4 are faithful paraphrases. ProSol P1 is an
  interpretive synthesis rather than source wording. IITA I3 (field confirmation)
  is a prudent product rule but was not found as a recommendation in the guide.
- Replaced the dead IITA download URL in source metadata with the CGIAR record and
  bitstream. ProSol's recorded URL remains live.
- Human agronomic review remains required. Both candidate summaries remain
  ineligible, no dose or matrix cell was approved, and the vector index was not
  rebuilt. No deployment, commit, push, provider call or field pilot performed.

### 2026-09-12 — Ticket 08 local keyboard and accessibility preparation

- Added a keyboard skip link and focusable main landmark. Soil-tool culture and
  location selectors now have distinct accessible names; decorative control icons
  are hidden from assistive technologies.
- Added reusable focus containment for the Sources and private-journal dialogs.
  Escape closes either dialog and restores its opener; the journal toggle exposes
  expanded state. Link and textarea focus indicators now match other controls.
- Verified in live Chromium's accessibility tree: skip target, dialog naming,
  cyclic focus, Escape restoration, soil-selector names, and no horizontal
  overflow at 320 × 900. Report saved under reports/browser_replay_check.
- Automated frontend asset tests and all 27 JavaScript tests passed. Physical
  phones, system screen readers, permission denial and participant usability
  remain human/device acceptance work. No deployment, commit or push performed.
- Fresh complete verification: 641 offline Python tests and 27 JavaScript tests
  passed; one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning. Browser scripts compiled and
  `git diff --check` passed.

### 2026-09-12 — Ticket 09 evaluation denominator preparation

- Extended scripts/farmer_evaluation.py so development (40 cases) and held-out
  (20 cases) scorecards can be prepared separately. Existing complete-scorecard
  behavior remains supported.
- Added a claim evidence ledger with exact case/split validation, unique claim ids,
  required source/page/excerpt/reviewer evidence and a true claim-level 90% gate.
- Added an anonymous participant/task ledger that requires all five planned tasks
  for at least eight participant codes and applies separate 80% independent-task
  and next-action-comprehension gates.
- Added evaluation/RELEASE_DECISION_TEMPLATE.md. It defaults to REPORTÉ and keeps
  critical safety, claim grounding and participant outcomes as separate gates.
- Six focused evaluation tests pass, including denominator boundaries, incomplete
  evidence, split isolation and missing tasks. No human results, expert identity,
  live-model score or release decision was invented.
- Fresh complete verification: 647 offline Python tests and 29 JavaScript tests
  passed with one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning. The evaluation script
  compiled and `git diff --check` passed.

### 2026-09-12 — Ticket 08 microphone permission recovery

- Added a full-index.js jsdom regression for a browser `NotAllowedError` from
  getUserMedia. The existing question remains in the input, manual controls stay
  enabled, and the microphone button returns to its idle accessible name.
- The regression exposed that permission guidance did not mention the immediately
  available keyboard fallback. Both MediaRecorder and native speech-recognition
  denial messages now explicitly offer typing while retaining permission advice.
- Updated the local accessibility report. Fresh verification: 647 offline Python
  tests and 30 JavaScript tests passed with one existing PyPDF2 warning;
  `git diff --check` passed. Physical phone permission UI remains unverified.

### 2026-09-12 — Independent review and improvement plan (Kimi)

- Reviewed the three plans in `plans/`, PROJECT_STATE, TODO and SESSION, then
  verified the claimed baseline: 640 offline Python tests passed, 27 JavaScript
  tests passed (credentialed RAG excluded), both matching the status doc.
- Found 28 modified files (+921/-81) uncommitted and the stash
  `codex-plan-integration-20260909` still present — flagged as the top risk (R1).
- Confirmed fertilizer doses remain withheld pending F6 agronomist review and that
  only two sources pass `core/source_policy.py` eligibility.
- Wrote `plans/KIMI_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2026-09-12.md` with phases K0 (commit/protect
  existing work), K1 (live end-to-end verification), K2 (grow eligible corpus),
  K3 (prepare the agronomist review packet), K4 (pilot readiness), K5 (human gates).
- No code changes, no commits, no deployment, no provider calls in this pass.

### 2026-09-12 — Kimi plan implementation (K0–K4)

- K0: committed the previously uncommitted hardening/verification work as
  `38cfbb19` on branch `chore/security-hardening-and-verification` (42 files,
  +1984/−97), including the coverage matrix, ticket report, browser replay
  artifacts, security/recovery/audio tests, and the Kimi plan. Added `tmp/` to
  `.gitignore` (review-PDF workspace was untracked but not ignored). The stash
  `codex-plan-integration-20260909` is fully merged into that commit and kept
  as a labeled backup. No push or PR yet — held for owner confirmation.
- K1: live verification passed — `/healthz` ok/rag ready, `/version` shows
  deployed commit `bc0670e3`; `scripts/evaluate_rag.py` against the live Space:
  14/14 hard-passed, 3 advisory warnings (expected thinner-corpus behavior
  after source-eligibility tightening). Report refreshed in
  `reports/rag_eval_results.md`.
- K2: trusted-source probe — 6/9 up. WASCAL recovered (both hosts UP; was DOWN
  in July), FAO AGRISurvey back up. INERA and AGRHYMET still DOWN. FAO
  countryprofiles URL now 404 (was UP in July) — seed URL needs updating.
  Logged in `reports/trusted_source_health.md`. No scrape/promote: human
  review gate unchanged.
- K3: created `Data/reviews/AGRONOMIST_REVIEW_PACKET_2026-09-12.md` (20 matrix
  cells with sign-off columns, unblock rule: nothing approved by silence) and
  `evaluation/BENCHMARK_APPROVAL_SHEET.md` (all 60 cases, held-out tuning ban).
  11 cells without candidate extracts are marked "à vérifier".
- K4: `/confidentialite` privacy policy page (French, retention from config)
  linked from the credibility modal; `.doc-page` styles. Server answer-cache
  hits now show a visible freshness label ("Réponse établie le …") in
  `static/js/api.js`; the offline label keeps precedence.
- Verification: 29 JavaScript tests passed (2 new freshness tests). Full
  offline Python suite result recorded below after the final run.
- Not done (human/offline gates): agronomist review session, benchmark
  approval, real-phone pilot, corpus scrape/promote, push/PR.
- Final verification: 643 offline Python tests passed (3 new privacy-page tests), 29 JavaScript tests passed; one PyPDF2 warning; credentialed RAG excluded.

### 2026-09-12 — Kimi plan second pass (review-feedback corrections)

- K1 evidence: local vector store rebuilt from the 2-source eligible corpus;
  manifest guard verified (accept on match); live Space serves the same corpus
  hash (x-dakikobo-corpus 828d5d06eeb22bba, pre-metadata); one complete live
  TTS fetch (valid MP3, 174 KB); evaluator 14/14 hard-pass. Dated record in
  reports/live_verification_2026-09-12.md. Credentialed local RAG not run.
- K2 partial: scope metadata ingested; quarantine (rights_unclear/_quarantine)
  always wins; FAO synthesis formally quarantined; dated eligibility audit
  regenerated (2 eligible, 1 quarantined, 34 pending). Four-source target
  blocked on human agronomic approval — exact remaining actions documented.
- K3 ready for human review: packet now embeds verbatim IITA/ProSol page
  annexes with hashes, page refs and fidelity notes; reviewer fields blank.
- K4 blocked/partial: no physical-phone test done; five-task rehearsal
  checklist with recording grid added under evaluation/.
- Commits 89b2c005, 603ceb8a, 78622caf on chore/security-hardening-and-verification.
  Verification: 650 offline Python tests, 30 JavaScript tests, git diff --check
  clean. This entry is intentionally left uncommitted to avoid sweeping another
  session's in-flight SESSION.md edits into these commits.
## 2026-09-12 — PR #5 Kimi continuation

### 2026-09-15 — Suite du plan HTML après fusion

- Suite opérationnelle : nouveau test de reprise via serveur HTTP loopback et client conservant son cookie ; restauration isolée, exclusion d'un second client et suppression propriétaire vérifiées.
- Vérification : 3 tests de récupération réussis, un avertissement PyPDF2. La première exécution a révélé une assertion de test incorrecte sur le contrat de suppression ; le contrat réel retourne `deleted: 0` pour un autre propriétaire et le cas reste intact.
- Contrôles distants en lecture seule : en-têtes de confidentialité présents, chemin du journal HTTP 404 ; API runtime sans preuve de volume durable. Compte rendu `reports/operational_readiness_2026-09-15.md`.
- Ticket 07 reste partiel ; aucun redémarrage distant, donnée réelle ou coût de stockage engagé.

- Nouvelle branche `codex/html-plan-remaining-work` basée sur `origin/main` à `e79ebfc3`, sans perte des changements locaux.
- Finalisation du message de reprise après refus microphone et de sa régression jsdom.
- Tableau de réception daté ajouté au rapport du plan ; modèle de décision de livraison préparé.
- Revue agronomique, volume durable de la cible, téléphone physique et pilote restent ouverts ; ticket 10 reste conditionnel.

- Continued Kimi's interrupted PR #5 correction pass after its provider quota ended.
- Preserved unrelated local microphone/accessibility work without staging it.
- Confirmed the integration stash was removed only after Kimi documented it as redundant.
- Prepared the current-head live verification record and refreshed committed RAG evaluation evidence.
- K2 remains partial pending human approval; K3 is ready for human review; K4 remains blocked pending the real-phone rehearsal.


### 2026-09-15 — Task C: Docker container replacement and journal continuity (HTML ticket 07)

- Added tests/docker_journal_rehearsal.py: a bounded, synthetic rehearsal that
  runs the production image on an isolated temporary host directory mounted at
  /data/dakikobo, with STATE_DB_PATH, CASE_LOG_DB_PATH and FEEDBACK_IMAGE_DIR
  set into that mount. It uses APP_ENV=production (production Secure cookie kept
  intact), a stable test-only secret, RAG_WARMUP_ON_START=false and empty
  provider keys, so no model or provider is called.
- Production Secure cookies are handled without weakening production: a
  test-only cookie-aware harness (SecureCookieClient) captures the owner cookie
  from Set-Cookie and re-sends it over HTTP, exactly as a browser over TLS
  would. The server keeps setting Secure cookies.
- Flow: save one explicitly consented synthetic case in the first container,
  keep the owner cookie, stop+remove the container, start a replacement from the
  same image/secret/mount, and verify: owner's case survived; a second client
  sees no case; a non-owner delete returns deleted:0 and leaves the case intact;
  the owner delete returns deleted:1 and removes it. Negative control: a fresh
  empty mount contains no case.
- Every container/HTTP step has a timeout; containers run with --rm and are
  force-removed in a finally block, so cleanup happens on success and failure.
  The bind mount is a throwaway temp dir (chmod 0777 so the uid-1000 container
  user can write the SQLite journal) removed at the end. The printed summary is
  booleans only; no cookie, secret, or database content is emitted.
- Added .github/workflows/docker-journal-rehearsal.yml (build image, run the
  rehearsal). Documented the local-bind-mount-vs-provider-durability
  distinction in DEPLOYMENT.md. The runner skips cleanly (exit 0) with
  --skip-if-no-docker when Docker is unavailable.
- Local verification: built the production image; rehearsal passed all seven
  assertions (owner survival, other-client exclusion, non-owner delete no-op,
  case intact, owner delete, case removed, fresh-mount empty); no lingering
  containers afterwards. `python -m pytest -q tests/test_recovery.py` → 3
  passed. Offline checks: 652 offline Python tests passed (1 PyPDF2 warning),
  30 JavaScript tests passed, offline fertilizer export unchanged, git
  diff --check clean.
- Limitation: this is local bind-mount persistence evidence only. It is NOT
  hosting-provider disk durability, host-rebuild/volume-migration recovery, or
  physical-browser/participant validation, which remain explicitly pending. No
  deployment, no production infrastructure change, no storage purchased, and no
  live-service restart.


### 2026-09-15 — PR #9 review fix: Docker isolation, negative control, cleanup

- Review findings addressed in tests/docker_journal_rehearsal.py (refactored
  into a `Rehearsal` object that owns only the containers it starts):
  - Unique names: each run gets a UUID token; containers are named
    `dakikobo-journal-<token>-{a,b,control}`. The run never force-removes a
    fixed/global name, so it cannot remove a container belonging to another run;
    it removes only the names it recorded as started.
  - Strengthened negative control: the positive (replacement) mount stays live
    and still holds the case; a separate container is started on a fresh empty
    mount; the SAME owner cookie is pointed at both. Asserts owner sees the case
    on the positive mount, sees no case on the empty mount, the positive case is
    intact after the control, and only THEN performs the owner deletion.
  - Reliable cleanup: `Rehearsal.cleanup()` removes each owned container
    independently, each with its own REMOVE_TIMEOUT, so a timeout/failure on one
    does not skip the others; it returns a list of cleanup errors instead of
    silently ignoring them. `rehearse()` runs the body, then in `finally`
    removes all containers BEFORE deleting the temp mount, and preserves the
    original error (via exception chaining) while appending any cleanup errors;
    a clean body with failing cleanup raises CleanupError.
  - `SecureCookieClient.retarget()` keeps the owner cookie across the port
    change between the original, replacement, and control containers.
- Tests: tests/test_docker_journal_rehearsal.py — seven failure-path unit tests
  that MOCK the Docker CLI (no daemon needed): unique per-run naming, cleanup
  removes only started containers, cleanup continues past a per-container
  removal timeout, cleanup reports removal failures, rehearse preserves the
  original error while reporting cleanup errors, rehearse raises CleanupError
  when the body passes but cleanup fails, and retarget keeps the cookie.
- Local verification: built the production image and ran the real rehearsal —
  all 9 assertions passed (incl. owner_sees_case_on_positive_mount,
  same_owner_sees_no_case_on_empty_mount, positive_case_intact_after_control),
  unique container names used, no lingering containers afterwards.
  `python -m pytest -q tests/test_recovery.py` → 3 passed. Offline checks: 659
  offline Python tests passed (1 PyPDF2 warning), 30 JavaScript tests passed,
  offline fertilizer export unchanged, git diff --check clean.
- Still local bind-mount persistence evidence only. Hosting-provider disk
  durability, host rebuild/volume migration, physical-phone testing, farmer
  pilot, and expert approval remain explicitly pending.


### 2026-09-15 — PR #9 review round 2: detect ordinary docker rm failures

- Review finding: `_remove_one` ran `docker rm -f` with check=False but ignored
  the return code, so a normal nonzero Docker result was treated as success and
  the container was untracked while possibly still running, which could
  invalidate the replacement rehearsal and leave the mount in use.
- Fix:
  - `_remove_one` now inspects `CompletedProcess.returncode`; a nonzero exit
    raises `RemovalFailed` with bounded stderr (300 chars) in the internal
    message. Timeouts still raise `TimeoutExpired`.
  - `stop()` untracks a container from `_started` only after a confirmed
    successful removal (the deliberate replacement no longer proceeds on an
    unconfirmed stop).
  - `cleanup()` attempts every owned container independently, reports all
    failures (timeout, nonzero, or exception), and keeps any unconfirmed
    container in `_started`. It never touches containers from another run
    (names are per-run UUID-scoped).
  - `rehearse()` deletes the bind-mount data only when no owned container
    removal is unconfirmed; otherwise it withholds the deletion, leaves the
    workspace, and reports it (`withheld mount cleanup: ...`) as a CleanupError,
    while still preserving any primary rehearsal error.
- Tests (tests/test_docker_journal_rehearsal.py, all mocked Docker): nonzero
  `docker rm -f` without an exception raises RemovalFailed with stderr; stop()
  keeps a failed container in `_started`; cleanup continues past a nonzero
  removal and reports it while removing the healthy container; mount cleanup is
  withheld (shutil.rmtree not called) and explicitly reported when a container
  removal is unconfirmed.
- Validation: 11 Docker helper unit tests passed; tests/test_recovery.py 3
  passed; real Docker journal rehearsal passed all 9 assertions with no
  lingering containers; full offline Python 663 passed (1 PyPDF2 warning); 30
  JavaScript passed; offline fertilizer export unchanged; git diff --check clean.
- Still local bind-mount persistence evidence only; hosting-provider durability,
  host rebuild, physical-phone, farmer pilot, and expert approval remain pending.


### 2026-09-15 — PR #9 review round 3: report workspace-deletion failures

- Review finding: rehearse() deleted the temp workspace with
  `shutil.rmtree(workspace, ignore_errors=True)`, silently hiding filesystem
  cleanup failures that the acceptance criteria require to be reported.
- Fix: replaced the silent call with explicit handling. On success the
  workspace is removed as before. On OSError, a bounded message
  (`failed to remove workspace <path>: <reason[:300]>`) is appended to
  cleanup_errors, preserving the workspace path; the existing logic then reports
  it as a CleanupError (clean body) or appends it to the preserved primary
  rehearsal error (failed body). Mount data is still only deleted when no owned
  container removal is unconfirmed (the withheld-cleanup branch is unchanged).
  Added _CLEANUP_MESSAGE_LIMIT (300) to bound the reported detail.
- Tests (tests/test_docker_journal_rehearsal.py, mocked): successful workspace
  deletion reports no error; rmtree failure after clean container cleanup is
  reported as CleanupError with the path + bounded reason; rmtree failure while
  a primary rehearsal error already exists preserves the primary error and
  reports the workspace failure alongside it (cause chain intact); the workspace
  cleanup error output is bounded (a 5000-char reason is not echoed in full).
- Validation: .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_docker_journal_rehearsal.py
  tests/test_recovery.py -> 18 passed (15 docker unit incl. 4 new, 3 recovery),
  1 PyPDF2 warning. Real Docker rehearsal passed all 9 assertions, no lingering
  containers. Full offline Python 667 passed; 30 JavaScript passed; offline
  fertilizer export unchanged; git diff --check clean;
  git diff --check origin/main...HEAD clean.
- Still local bind-mount persistence evidence only; provider durability, host
  rebuild, physical-phone, farmer pilot, and expert approval remain pending.

### 2026-09-15 — Task B: automate headless-browser rehearsal in CI (HTML ticket 08)

- Made tests/browser_replay_check.py a self-contained, reproducible runner: it
  starts tests/browser_fixture_app.py itself, waits for readiness with a hard
  deadline, runs the checks at 320 px and 1280 px, and always tears the fixture
  process down (terminate then kill) even on assertion/startup/timeout failure.
  Any failure exits non-zero. Added --port/--startup-timeout/--widths flags.
- Checks covered: keyboard navigation (skip link -> main landmark), modal focus
  containment + Escape restoration for both the credibility and journal dialogs,
  no horizontal overflow at each width, and audio-failure recovery (undecodable
  audio keeps the French text answer and shows the "indisponible" status).
- Fixed a stale assertion: the credibility dialog now contains a second
  focusable control (privacy link), so the trap cycles focus between controls.
  The check now asserts focus stays *contained* in the dialog while tabbing
  rather than pinned on one element.
- Audio recovery is made deterministic across media stacks: full Chromium fires
  the media 'error' from the undecodable payload; a headless build without a
  media pipeline may not, so a context init script captures the Audio elements
  the app creates and the runner emits the same 'error' event the browser would,
  which drives the app's real onFailure handler. The fixture serves a synthetic
  /broken-audio.mp3 (undecodable, no provider) and a /healthz readiness probe.
- Declared a pinned test-only dependency in requirements-browser.txt
  (playwright==1.55.0), kept OUT of the production requirements.txt. Added
  .github/workflows/browser-rehearsal.yml: installs requirements +
  requirements-browser, `playwright install --with-deps chromium`, runs the
  rehearsal at 320/1280, then two non-fatal verification steps that prove the
  rehearsal detects (a) an injected failed assertion and (b) a fixture-startup
  failure, and uploads screenshots/results.json/fixture.log as CI artifacts on
  every run. Generated screenshots and results.json are now git-ignored and were
  untracked; the dated accessibility markdown report stays committed.
- The deliberate-failure hook (BROWSER_REPLAY_INJECT_FAILURE) is opt-in and off
  by default; it is exercised only by the CI failure-detection step, never left
  enabled in the committed default run.
- Local verification (headless-shell sandbox): rehearsal passed 320/1280 on
  three consecutive runs (deterministic); injected-assertion run exited 1;
  short-deadline startup run exited 1; no orphan fixture processes remained.
  Offline checks: 652 offline Python tests passed (1 PyPDF2 warning), 30
  JavaScript tests passed, offline fertilizer export unchanged, git diff --check
  clean.
- Results are headless-browser evidence only. Physical-phone testing, system
  screen readers, real permission dialogs, and farmer/participant usability
  remain human/device acceptance work and stay explicitly pending.


### 2026-09-15 — PR #8 review fix: capture real browser failure evidence

- Review findings addressed in tests/browser_replay_check.py and its workflow:
  - Per-invocation artifact directory: artifacts now live under
    reports/browser_replay_check/<run-id>/ (--run-id / BROWSER_REPLAY_RUN_ID;
    default timestamp+pid). The normal, injected-failure, and startup-failure
    CI runs each use a distinct run id, so failure-detection runs can no longer
    overwrite or reuse the normal run's evidence.
  - On any assertion/exception, `_capture_failure` writes failure-<width>.png
    and a structured error.json (error type, message, full traceback,
    screenshot name, partial results) BEFORE the browser context is closed;
    the error is then re-raised. A passing run still writes replay-<width>.png
    and results.json.
  - results.json now records `audio_failure_mode`: "native" when full Chromium
    raised the media error itself, or "synthetic-error-event" when the runner
    emitted the media 'error' on the app's Audio element for a headless build
    without a media pipeline. Both drive the app's real onFailure handler.
  - The CI workflow gives each step a distinct --run-id, asserts the
    injected-failure run left error.json + failure-320.png, and uploads the
    whole reports/browser_replay_check/** tree with if: always() so failure
    artifacts are uploaded even when a step exits non-zero.
  - Fixture, context, and browser cleanup remain reliable (context.close in
    finally per width; fixture terminate/kill in finally; browser.close in
    finally).
- Tests: tests/test_browser_replay_check.py — a browser-free unit test proving
  `_capture_failure` writes the screenshot + error.json (with traceback), and a
  Chromium-gated end-to-end test that runs the rehearsal with an injected early
  failure and asserts exit 1 plus error.json + failure-320.png. The e2e test
  skips when Chromium is not installed (e.g. the offline regression job) and
  runs in the browser-rehearsal job.
- Local verification (Chromium headless-shell): normal run passed 320/1280 with
  audio_failure_mode recorded; injected-failure run exited 1 and produced
  error.json + failure-320.png in its own dir; startup-failure run exited 1 in
  its own dir; no cross-run overwrite; run dirs are git-ignored. Offline checks:
  654 offline Python tests passed (1 PyPDF2 warning), 30 JavaScript tests
  passed, offline fertilizer export unchanged, git diff --check clean.
- Still headless-browser evidence only. Physical-phone testing, farmer pilot,
  expert approval, and hosting-provider durability remain pending.


### 2026-09-15 — PR #8 follow-up: import-safe without Playwright

- The first review-fix push failed the offline `regression` CI job: that job
  does not install the test-only Playwright dependency, and
  tests/test_browser_replay_check.py imports tests/browser_replay_check.py,
  which imported playwright at module top level -> ModuleNotFoundError at
  collection.
- Fix: import Playwright lazily via `_load_playwright()` called inside `run()`.
  The module (and the failure-capture unit test) now import cleanly without
  Playwright; the Chromium-gated e2e test skips where it is absent. Verified by
  simulating a missing playwright import locally.
- CI after the fix: regression, chromium-rehearsal, and build-and-smoke all
  green on ci/browser-rehearsal.

### 2026-09-15 — Task A: display source scope and limits (HTML ticket 05)

- Reviewed Markdown ingestion already preserved `scope` in chunk metadata
  (core/rag_pipeline.py allow-list). The only drop point was core/retrieval.py:
  the `SourceCard` dataclass, `_source_card_from_doc`, `_as_source_cards` and
  `as_dict()` never carried `scope`, so it was lost before the response.
- Added `scope` to `SourceCard` (+`as_dict()` optional-key loop), read it
  verbatim in `_source_card_from_doc`, and passed it in `_as_source_cards`.
  Retrieval never infers a scope, zone or approval; absent scope omits the key.
- Because app.py, core/case.py and the answer cache pass source dicts through
  opaquely, and the service worker caches the full `/ask` JSON, scope now rides
  through live answers, the field-case card, the answer cache and offline
  (saved-case) replay with no further change. Saved-journal replay is handled by
  the 2026-09-15 review-fix pass below (schema v6 sources column).
- Frontend: render.js renders a dedicated `.source-scope` line under the French
  label "Portée et limites", inserted via jQuery `.text()` so HTML-like scope
  renders literally and cannot execute markup. Added `.source-scope` CSS that
  wraps and stays readable at 320 px. Extended the credibility modal copy to
  mention "portée déclarée".
- Tests: extended tests/test_ingestion.py (scope survives ingestion),
  tests/test_retrieval.py (`as_dict` keeps scope + omits when absent),
  tests/test_app_routes.py (scope survives /ask answer construction),
  tests/test_frontend_assets.py (wiring), and added tests/js/source_scope.test.js
  (jsdom regressions: scope renders, absent scope omitted, unsafe markup is
  literal — no injected img/script node).
- Offline checks: 653 offline Python tests passed (1 PyPDF2 warning); 33
  JavaScript tests passed; offline fertilizer export unchanged; git diff --check
  clean. No source promotion, new advice or fertilizer-dose change.
- Not done: K2 corpus growth and agronomic approval remain pending.
  Physical-phone, farmer pilot and provider durability stay pending.

### 2026-09-15 — PR #7 review fix: saved-journal scope replay (schema v6)

- Review finding: Task A required scope to survive saving AND reopening a
  journal case, but the server journal stored only question/answer. Fixed with a
  backward-compatible migration so saved cases replay their sources.
- Schema: bumped SCHEMA_VERSION 5 -> 6 with additive `_migrate_to_v6` adding a
  nullable `sources` TEXT column to feedback_events. Existing rows keep NULL and
  replay as no sources; the existing v1->current migration test now also asserts
  a pre-v6 row reads back `sources IS NULL`.
- Persistence: `record_feedback(..., sources=...)` stores a compact JSON of the
  answer's source cards via `normalize_sources_json` (verbatim dict/str cards,
  20k-char cap, rejects non-lists). `save_owned` passes it through. `/feedback`
  accepts an optional `sources` form field (JSON list, size-checked) and never
  reconstructs or invents sources.
- Replay: `list_owned` selects `sources` and decodes it with
  `decode_sources_json` (NULL/corrupt -> []). The due digest still strips
  question/answer/sources. Frontend: `renderFeedback` sends the answer's source
  cards on save; the journal panel calls `renderSources($item, item.sources)`
  so reopened cases show the source cards, including the French
  "Portée et limites" line, via .text() (unsafe markup stays literal).
- Owner isolation, retention/expiry cleanup, deletion, and French UI text are
  unchanged; sources ride the same owner-scoped rows and are deleted with them.
- Tests: tests/test_case_log.py (persist+decode, NULL when absent, oversized
  rejected, corrupt-blob tolerance, pre-v6 legacy row), tests/test_app_routes.py
  (obtain answer with scope -> save -> reopen via /journal -> scope survives; and
  a legacy case without sources reopens as []), tests/test_frontend_assets.py
  (renderFeedback sends sources, journal panel replays them). The JavaScript
  tests for absent scope and literal unsafe-markup rendering are unchanged.
- Never reconstructs missing historical sources; legacy cases stay readable.


### 2026-09-15 — PR #7 review round 2: French validation for malformed sources

- Review finding: malformed source cards still surfaced English validation text.
  normalize_sources_json raises English ValueErrors ("each source must be a
  dict or string", "sources payload is too large to store") and the /feedback
  route's `except ValueError: return {"error": str(exc)}` could return that text
  to the user; also `sources='[1]'` passed the boundary (a JSON list) and failed
  only inside record_feedback.
- Fix: validate every source entry at the /feedback HTTP boundary by calling the
  canonical normalize_sources_json there and mapping any ValueError/TypeError to
  the stable French message « Les sources du conseil sont invalides. ». The
  oversized-payload branch now returns the same French message (using the
  shared MAX_SOURCES_JSON_CHARS cap). Internal validator text is never returned.
- Valid sources and legacy (no-sources) journal behavior are unchanged; nothing
  is persisted when the payload is rejected.
- Tests (tests/test_app_routes.py): sources='[1]' -> 400 with the French
  message and no English wording, nothing saved; oversized JSON -> 400 French,
  nothing saved; valid cards still save and replay their scope.
- Validation: full offline Python 663 passed (1 PyPDF2 warning), 33 JavaScript
  passed, offline fertilizer export unchanged, git diff --check clean.

## 2026-09-17 — K2 FEAT-002 : tests de reproductibilité de l'évaluation Ticket 09

- Branche `k2-release-evaluation`. Ajout de tests significatifs (aucun changement
  de code de production nécessaire : `scripts/farmer_evaluation.py` applique déjà
  toutes les garanties requises, confirmé par l'audit FEAT-001).
- `tests/test_farmer_evaluation.py` couvre désormais les cinq catégories exigées,
  chaque test échouerait si la garantie correspondante était annulée :
  1. Preuve manquante : scorecard vierge + registres affirmation/tâche vides
     échouent (fail-closed) ; ligne d'affirmation sans `source`/`page`/`excerpt`/
     `reviewer` échoue ; ligne de tâche sans `observer` échoue.
  2. Doublons d'identifiants : `assess()` rejette les doublons de `id`,
     `assess_claims()` rejette les doublons `(case_id, claim_id)`, `assess_tasks()`
     rejette les doublons `(participant_code, task_id)`.
  3. Dénominateurs : ancrage des affirmations = nombre de lignes d'affirmation
     (9/10 => 90 %) ; réussite/compréhension pilote = observations participant ×
     tâche (40/40 sur 8 × 5) ; les résumés indiquent le bon dénominateur.
  4. Bornes de seuil exactes : ancrage exactement 90 % passe, 8/9 (88,9 %) échoue ;
     pilote exactement 80 % (32/40) passe, 31/40 échoue ; les DEUX portes sont
     indépendantes (complétion 80 % mais compréhension < 80 % échoue).
  5. Décisions fail-closed : un cas de sécurité critique en échec force l'échec
     malgré des moyennes élevées ; toute preuve manquante maintient l'échec
     (aucun registre ne peut renvoyer un succès sans preuve).
- Seuils du plan inchangés (≥ 90 % ancrage, ≥ 80 % réussite, ≥ 80 % compréhension) ;
  formulation française et refus de sécurité préservés.
- Totaux de tests (exacts) : (1) `tests/test_farmer_evaluation.py

  daté, identité reproductible, décision REPORTÉE, champs humains vides, commande
  documentée sans identifiants, et déterminisme.
- Totaux de tests (exacts) : (1) `tests/test_farmer_evaluation.py
  tests/test_evidence_ledger.py tests/test_evaluate_rag.py tests/test_release_decision.py`
  => 49 passed ; (2) `tests --ignore=tests/test_rag.py` => 703 passed, 1 skipped,

  d'éligibilité `Data/reviews/*`. `NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED` inchangé. P2 non restauré.

## K2 — Corrections PR #16 (partie 1 : code + tests)

- Correction 1 (isolement des splits) : `assess_claims` dans
  `scripts/farmer_evaluation.py` calcule désormais le seuil de fondement de 90 %
  INDÉPENDAMMENT par split présent dans le registre. En mode combiné (plusieurs
  splits), le résumé nomme explicitement le « combined mode » et rapporte le
  supported/total et le pourcentage de CHAQUE split ; la réussite exige que
  chaque split atteigne indépendamment ≥ 90 %. Une preuve development à 100 % ne
  peut plus masquer un held_out en échec. Le comportement mono-split (résumé
  `Claim grounding N/T (P%). Denominator: substantive claims reviewed.`) est
  préservé.
- Régressions ajoutées (`tests/test_farmer_evaluation.py`, catégorie 6) avec de
  vrais ids held_out du benchmark (`agronomy_03`) : development 100 % + held_out
  80 % ÉCHOUE ; le résumé du mode combiné nomme chaque split et son taux ; un
  registre combiné où chaque split atteint ≥ 90 % PASSE ; un development en échec
  n'est pas sauvé par un held_out fort.
- Correction 2 (régénération reproductible) : ajout des entrées CLI explicites
  `--commit SHA` et `--date YYYY-MM-DD` qui alimentent
  `generate_release_decision(commit=..., generated_on=...)`. L'identité du
  scaffold est le COMMIT DE CODE ÉVALUÉ, passé explicitement ; le défaut (HEAD
  courant + aujourd'hui) ne reproduit PAS un artefact déjà committé. Commande
  exacte de régénération byte-for-byte de
  `evaluation/RELEASE_DECISION_SCAFFOLD_2026-09-17.md` :
  `.venv/bin/python scripts/farmer_evaluation.py --generate-decision 2026-09-17 --commit a41c842d6febbdf38d1cf771875ed59102094a2b --date 2026-09-17`.
  Test de parité `test_regenerates_committed_scaffold_byte_for_byte` : régénère
  l'artefact depuis ses entrées déclarées dans `tmp_path` et compare les octets
  exacts avec le fichier committé.
- Correction 3 (isolement des tests) : `generate_release_decision` accepte un
  paramètre `output_dir` (défaut `EVALUATION_DIR`) rendant le répertoire de
  sortie injectable. `test_bare_date_target_uses_dated_convention` écrit
  désormais sous `tmp_path` et le `.unlink()` touchant le vrai arbre
  `evaluation/` est supprimé. Test de protection
  `test_generation_never_touches_committed_artifact` : capture les octets du
  scaffold 2026-09-17 committé, génère dans `tmp_path`, puis vérifie qu'il est
  inchangé et toujours présent.
- Format de rendu du scaffold INCHANGÉ ; l'artefact committé (a41c842 /
  2026-09-17, décision REPORTÉE, toutes portes en attente) reste reproductible
  byte-for-byte. `git diff --exit-code -- evaluation/RELEASE_DECISION_SCAFFOLD_2026-09-17.md`
  => propre après exécution de la commande documentée.
- Totaux de tests (exacts) : `rm -rf scripts/__pycache__ tests/__pycache__ &&
  .venv/bin/pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_farmer_evaluation.py tests/test_release_decision.py`
  => 36 passed, 1 warning (PyPDF2) ; suite complète
  `tests --ignore=tests/test_rag.py` => 709 passed, 1 skipped, 1 warning.
- Contraintes respectées : aucun changement à `core/fertilizer.py`,
  `core/source_policy.py`, `static/data/fertilizer.json`, ni aux verdicts
  d'éligibilité `Data/reviews/*`. `NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED` inchangé. P2 non
  restauré. Textes utilisateur en français préservés. (Corrections 4-6 —
  suppression métadonnées, fusion origin/main, régénération finale et docs PR —
  traitées séparément.)

### 2026-09-17 : Index des preuves (tâche légère L1)

- Créé `evaluation/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` : index d'une page pointant vers les
  artefacts canoniques des six catégories de preuve (revue des sources,
  répétition navigateur, continuité du journal, répétition téléphone,
  approbation du benchmark, décision de livraison) avec leur statut
  (`automated`, `human pending`, `phone pending`, `agronomist pending`,
  `hosting pending`). Aucun résultat copié, aucun relecteur ni date
  inventés ; seuls des liens vers les fichiers faisant autorité.
- Travail documentaire uniquement, en worktree séparé sur la branche
  `docs/evidence-index` depuis `origin/main`. Aucun code applicatif, aucune
  promotion de source, aucun déploiement.
- Vérification : script de résolution des liens relatifs du plan L1 et
  `git diff --check` — résultats rapportés dans la PR brouillon.

## K2 — Corrections PR #16 (partie 2 : intégration et finalisation)

- Implémentation finale résumée fidèlement (corrections 1 à 6 de la PR #16) :
  1. Isolement des splits (option b) : `assess_claims` calcule le seuil de
     fondement de 90 % INDÉPENDAMMENT par split présent dans le registre ; en
     mode combiné, le résumé identifie explicitement le « combined mode » et
     rapporte supported/total et pourcentage de CHAQUE split ; la réussite exige
     que chaque split (development ET held_out) atteigne ≥ 90 % de façon
     indépendante. Une preuve development à 100 % ne peut plus masquer un
     held_out en échec. Régressions ajoutées le prouvant.
  2. Scaffold reproductible : entrées CLI explicites `--commit SHA` et
     `--date YYYY-MM-DD` alimentant `generate_release_decision`. L'identité est
     le COMMIT DE CODE ÉVALUÉ passé explicitement (le défaut HEAD/aujourd'hui ne
     prétend PAS reproduire un artefact committé). Test de parité
     `test_regenerates_committed_scaffold_byte_for_byte` comparant les octets
     exacts. Commande documentée byte-for-byte :
     `.venv/bin/python scripts/farmer_evaluation.py --generate-decision 2026-09-17 --commit a41c842d6febbdf38d1cf771875ed59102094a2b --date 2026-09-17`.
  3. Isolement des tests : `generate_release_decision` accepte `output_dir`
     (défaut `EVALUATION_DIR`) ; tous les tests écrivent sous `tmp_path`, le
     `.unlink()` touchant le vrai arbre `evaluation/` est supprimé ; test de
     protection `test_generation_never_touches_committed_artifact`.
  4. Métadonnées internes retirées : `git rm -r
     .agents/tasks/task-k2-release-evaluation/` (context.json, task.json,
     features/FEAT-001..003.json, 2026-09-18-000000-review.md). Artefacts
     d'orchestration, pas des livrables projet.
  5. Intégration `origin/main` (31041731) par FUSION (pas rebase, pour préserver
     le SHA `a41c842` enregistré comme identité on-branch du scaffold). Seul
     conflit : `SESSION.md` (ajouts des deux côtés) résolu en PRÉSERVANT LES DEUX
     HISTORIQUES (toutes les entrées K2 ET l'entrée PR #17 « Index des preuves »).
     `evaluation/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` (nouveau de PR #17) inchangé, byte-identique
     à main.
  6. Régénération finale du scaffold via la commande documentée : aucun
     changement d'octet (parité prouvée). Décision globale REPORTÉE
     (`[x] REPORTER`, `[ ] LIVRER`, `[ ] RÉDUIRE`) ; toutes les portes
     humaine/agronomique/téléphone/pilote/modèle-en-direct/hébergement restent
     « en attente » (résultats « À mesurer »).
- Totaux de tests (exacts) : (1) `tests/test_farmer_evaluation.py
  tests/test_evidence_ledger.py tests/test_evaluate_rag.py test_release_decision.py`
  => 36 passed, 1 warning (PyPDF2) ; (2) `tests --ignore=tests/test_rag.py` =>
  709 passed, 1 skipped, 1 warning ; (3) `pnpm test:js` => 33 pass ;
  (4) `git diff --check` => propre. `tests/test_rag.py` exclu (Groq/HF en ligne).
- Contraintes respectées : aucun changement à `core/fertilizer.py`,
  `core/source_policy.py`, `static/data/fertilizer.json`, ni aux verdicts
  d'éligibilité `Data/reviews/*`. `NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED = False` inchangé.
  P2 (attribution ProSol de PR #13) non restauré. Aucun relecteur, participant,
  approbation, résultat ou preuve en direct inventé. Formulation française et
  refus de sécurité préservés. PR reste brouillon ; aucun push ni déploiement.

### 2026-09-17 : Suivi de revue PR #16 — isolation des splits sur le scorecard (K2)

- Contexte : la revue v1 (APPROUVÉE) a noté que la correction 1 avait été
  appliquée au registre de réclamations (`assess_claims`, par split) mais PAS à
  la fonction scorecard `assess()`, qui continuait de mutualiser
  grounding/success/understood sur development+held_out en mode benchmark complet
  (split=all). Un development parfait pouvait donc masquer arithmétiquement un
  held_out en échec sur les portes qualité du scorecard.
- Correctif (`scripts/farmer_evaluation.py`, `assess()`) : en mode combiné
  (les deux splits présents), les portes grounding >= 90 %, task completion
  >= 80 % et next action understood >= 80 % sont désormais calculées et exigées
  INDÉPENDAMMENT par split ; le scorecard ne passe que si CHAQUE split atteint
  seul les trois seuils. La porte de sécurité critique reste par cas (inchangée).
  Le résumé identifie clairement « combined mode (split=all) … per split » et
  rapporte les taux par split. Les chemins mono-split (development seul ou
  held_out seul) et leurs messages sont strictement inchangés (tests
  pré-existants passent verbatim).
- Régressions (`tests/test_farmer_evaluation.py`) : (a) un scorecard complet
  avec development parfait mais held_out grounding à 85 % ÉCHOUE (mutualisé il
  serait à 95 % et passerait) ; (b) le résumé en mode combiné nomme chaque split
  et ses taux ; (c) un scorecard où LES DEUX splits atteignent tous les seuils
  (held_out task completion exactement 80 %) PASSE ; (d) held_out task completion
  75 % ÉCHOUE. Les cas critiques restent safety_pass=yes pour isoler la porte
  qualité. Ces tests échoueraient si `assess()` revenait à la mutualisation.
- Issue latente 2 (revue) : documentée seulement (docstring de
  `generate_release_decision`) — un chemin de sortie complet + `--date` ignore la
  date dans le nom de fichier ; le flux de régénération documenté utilise une
  date nue et n'est pas affecté. Aucun changement de comportement, parité
  préservée.
- Vérifications : parité scaffold `git diff --exit-code` => propre (décision
  toujours REPORTÉE, toutes portes en attente). Aucun changement à
  `core/fertilizer.py`, `core/source_policy.py`, `static/data/fertilizer.json`,
  ni éligibilité `Data/reviews/*`. `NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED = False` inchangé.
  P2 non restauré. Aucun relecteur/participant/résultat inventé. PR reste
  brouillon ; aucun push.

### 2026-09-20 — Synchronization audit; execution blocked by task permissions

- Owner explicitly requested finalization and synchronization of GitHub, local
  checkout and Hugging Face Space. No human agronomic or pilot evidence supplied.
- GitHub connector confirmed main at
  `d7e7b0de45bd332d5d3321b7fb124dc0e0a09146`. Local checkout remains on
  `docs/human-validation-checklist` at `194f1f11`; existing local changes preserved.
- Only open PR found: #16, release-evaluation tooling, head
  `f4c58352c6ef3aed9df345ae60e1a8474b3d6d39`. Inspected its patch and fresh
  GitHub workflow status: offline regression, Docker build, headless browser,
  and Docker journal continuity all succeeded. The regression job confirms
  Python, JavaScript and generated fertilizer parity steps succeeded.
- Requested draft-to-ready transition for #16 was rejected by the connector:
  approval required but this task's approval policy is never. No merge performed.
- Local Git cannot write `.git/FETCH_HEAD` or Git LFS temporary files
  (Operation not permitted). No checkout, commit, fetch or push completed.
- Live Space HTTP probe returned 403. Browser access to huggingface.co was
  explicitly denied by browser security policy; no alternate route attempted
  after that denial. No HF deployment or live-version verification completed.
- Interrupted local Python suite did not produce a valid completion result:
  network access to api.open-meteo.com was blocked. npm was absent from PATH;
  bundled Node was located, but no JavaScript run was completed locally.
- Next: restore task access/approvals, recheck PR head and CI, merge verified
  PR #16, preserve local changes while updating the checkout, finish the remaining
  K3/K4 and L3/L4 plan work, then deploy the exact accepted revision through the
  separate HF history and verify build, health, version and live smoke results.
- Agronomist review, physical-phone/pilot observations and provider durability
  remain pending. No release approval or successful synchronization is claimed.

### 2026-09-20 — Access restored; integration and remaining preparation

- Git fetch/push access restored and live Space /version reachable. Pre-deploy
  Space revision a2798eb3, RAG ready, journal schema v5.
- PR #16 merged at GitHub main 666a726c after verifying its four successful CI
  workflows. Fresh combined-code local verification: 713 Python passed,
  1 skipped, 1 PyPDF2 warning; 33 JavaScript passed; credentialed local RAG excluded.
- K3 provider-neutral preflight/rebuild/restore/rollback procedure prepared in
  evaluation/HOSTING_VALIDATION.md using existing automated fixture modes.
  Actual provider durability remains unproven; no human evidence fabricated.
- K4/L4 corrected stale README source/dose claims, marked previous state snapshots
  historical, replaced the obsolete direct-HF-push recipe, and repaired relative
  links in the historical assessment. L3 static French UI audit recorded no
  observed issue within its stated scope. Evidence index updated.
- Fertilizer asset parity and diff checks passed. Relative documentation file
  links checked across README, state, implementation, deployment, evaluation,
  source reviews and plans; no broken file targets after repairs.
- Existing shared-checkout changes remain preserved. Deployment and final local
  synchronization follow only after these changes are accepted into main.

### 2026-09-21 — GitHub, local checkout and Hugging Face synchronized

- PR #16 (release-evaluation hardening) merged into GitHub main, followed by
  PR #19 (provider-validation preparation and documentation reconciliation).
  GitHub main and the local main checkout now point to `62d357d7`.
- PR #19's four checks passed: offline regression, Docker build, headless
  Chromium rehearsal and Docker journal continuity. GitHub has no open PRs.
- Fresh combined-code verification before deployment: 713 Python tests passed,
  1 skipped, with one existing PyPDF2 deprecation warning; all 33 JavaScript
  tests passed. Offline fertilizer export parity, diff checks and 121 relative
  documentation links also passed.
- Deployed GitHub main `62d357d7` through the separate Hugging Face history as
  Space commit `33d59d00`. The deployed files were compared byte-for-byte with
  the tracked GitHub snapshot before the HF commit; HF LFS attributes were kept.
- Live Space verification: runtime RUNNING on cpu-basic; `/version` reports
  `33d59d00`, journal schema v6 and RAG ready; `/healthz` is healthy with warm-up
  complete. Security headers were present and private paths returned 404.
- Live strict RAG evaluation passed 14/14 hard checks (100%, required 75%) with
  3 advisory warnings. The final temporary report was written outside the repo
  so historical committed evaluation evidence was not overwritten.
- Hugging Face reports no persistent storage allocation. The demo is updated,
  but provider journal durability remains unproven and release status remains
  REPORTÉE pending agronomist approval, physical-phone testing, participant
  results and provider durability evidence.
- Existing untracked local files were preserved. The earlier interrupted
  SESSION edit remains in a named Git stash and a private `.git` backup; neither
  is part of the deployed application or GitHub history.

### 2026-09-21 — Restore Hugging Face App-tab embedding

- User screenshot reproduced Firefox refusing the Space iframe while the direct
  `hf.space` URL remained healthy. The live response sent both
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'`, which forbid the
  Hugging Face Space page from embedding the running application.
- Added a failing HTTP-header regression first, then restricted CSP framing to
  `'self'`, `https://huggingface.co` and `https://*.huggingface.co`. Removed the
  obsolete `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, which cannot express this origin allowlist.
- Other CSP directives and browser protections remain unchanged. Deployment
  documentation now describes the intended Hugging Face-only embedding policy.

### 2026-09-21 — Prevent greeting and weed-answer hallucinations

- Reproduced two live answer-quality failures: a standalone `hi` was rendered
  as sourced agricultural advice, and an arachide weed question reached the LLM
  with a high-scoring institutional programme document that contained no weed
  evidence.
- Added a deterministic, source-free greeting response with no advice case.
  Added a pre-generation evidence rule for weed/desherbage questions: crop
  metadata alone is insufficient, and a chunk must mention the requested weed
  concepts before the LLM may see it.
- Included retrieval policy code in the safety revision digest so deployments
  invalidate answers cached under the previous grounding policy.
- The first live deployment revealed that a generic shared word (`culture`)
  still admitted the institutional chunk. Tightened the rule to require a real
  weed/desherbage concept in the chunk and extended the regressions with that
  live-shaped false match before redeploying.
