# DakiKobo — AI Agricultural Advisor for Burkina Faso 🌾

DakiKobo is a French-language AI assistant for smallholder farmers in Burkina Faso.
It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline restricted to reviewed
local sources. Currently only the CILSS and MAERAH/OAPH orientation summaries are
eligible; technical guides remain candidates pending review. Unsupported field
questions must receive an honest fallback, not an invented recommendation.

The focus crops are **mil (millet), sorgho (sorghum), maïs (maize), niébé (cowpea)
and arachide (groundnut)**. All output — answers, UI labels and voice — is in French,
and the interface is mobile-first for use on phones.

1. **Contexte parcelle** (optionnel) — culture, stade, lieu ; activez **Français simple** pour des phrases plus claires.
2. **Question texte** — ex. « Quand semer le mil ? » → carte *Conseil agricole* + sources.
3. **Engrais** — ex. « Dose d'engrais pour le sorgho » → conseil **déterministe**, doses chiffrées suspendues jusqu’à validation agronomique + confirmation par un agent.
4. **Photo de feuille** — dépistage prudent (*pas un diagnostic*).
5. **Sources & limites** — preuves, météo/sol indicatifs, confirmation terrain obligatoire.

## Features

- **Grounded French answers** — RAG over a local document corpus; off-topic questions
  fall back to an honest "je ne sais pas" instead of hallucinating.
- **Source citations and evidence ledger** — one scored retrieval grounds both the generated
  answer and its ranked source cards; every kept or dropped chunk is recorded by salted question
  hash with its score and citation decision for private offline evaluation.
- **Fast inference** — Groq-hosted `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, with reasoning tokens
  hidden so answers stay short and farmer-readable.
- **Multilingual retrieval** — `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` embeddings for
  good French matching, stored in a **persistent ChromaDB** (built once, fast on restart).
- **Hosted warm-up** — the Docker Space can prepare RAG in the background after startup so the
  first public question is less likely to pay the full indexing cost.
- **Shared answer and context cache** — SQLite WAL serves repeat grounded answers immediately and
  shares weather, soil, and privacy-safe ops state across two threaded workers; Chroma startup is
  serialized across workers to prevent concurrent schema migrations.
- **Voice output (TTS)** — answers can auto-play in French via gTTS and be replayed
  from their answer bubble.
- **Voice input (STT)** — records a short browser audio clip and transcribes it with
  Groq Whisper, with native browser speech recognition as a fallback.
- **Quota-safe public examples** — one-tap demo answers for text, fertilizer guidance and a
  sample image case, without spending live API calls.
- **Focused mobile UI** — examples stay visible, while weather and soil tools sit behind an
  `Outils` drawer so the conversation remains the main workspace.
- **Trust panel** — a compact `Sources & limites` dialog explains evidence, approximate signals,
  and required field confirmation.
- **Safety-gated fertilizer guidance** — fertilizer intent and crop handling remain deterministic,
  but exact numeric doses are withheld online and offline until an agronomist verifies each value
  against an exact source, formulation, zone and timing.
- **Offline-first PWA** — after one connected load, the app shell, registry, demo examples and
  previously saved answers remain available; fertilizer questions receive the same safety-gated
  response offline, while uncached questions receive an honest offline notice.
- **Leaf disease screening (optional)** — upload a leaf photo for a hedged French screening via
  Gemini Vision, with a "ceci n'est pas un diagnostic" disclaimer (requires a Gemini API key).
- **Weather-aware field signals** — Open-Meteo rainfall, ET0, soil moisture and short-term
  forecast cards for selected Burkina Faso locations.
- **Soil-aware fertilizer context** — SoilGrids texture, organic carbon, pH and retention-risk
  classes combined with deterministic fertilizer guidance.
- **Private field journal** — explicit consent, anonymous browser ownership, 90-day retention,
  deletion, optional re-encoded follow-up photos, and a seven-day in-app follow-up date. Legacy
  unowned records are never exposed through public journal routes. A saved case also retains and
  replays its source cards, including each source's declared scope shown under the French label
  « Portée et limites »; cases saved before this feature simply replay without sources (their
  sources are never reconstructed).
- **Français simple** — plain-language mode is enabled by default, with a field glossary (NPK,
  microdose, OAPH, etc.).
- **Reviewed-source ingestion** — Markdown and PDF candidates fail closed unless their metadata
  records an approved owner or agronomist review; startup no longer ingests network content directly.
- **Shared resource budgets** — per-client and global SQLite limits work across server workers
  without retaining raw client addresses.
- **Field weather enrichment** — known locations can attach rainfall / water-stress signals to answers.
- **Mobile-first responsive UI** — fills the screen on phones, input pinned to the bottom.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10 or 3.11**
- A **Groq API key** (from the [Groq console](https://console.groq.com))
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) recommended for fast environments
  (plain `venv` + `pip` also works)

### 1. Create the environment and install dependencies

Using `uv` (recommended):

```bash
uv venv .venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with standard tools:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure your API key

Export secrets into the local process environment. The Flask web process does
not load secret files:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY='your_real_key_here'
```

Optional — leaf disease screening needs a Google Gemini key (from
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)):

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_api_key_here'
```

For hosted deployments, set the same names in the provider's Secrets or
Environment panel. Do not upload a `.env` or place one below `public_html`.

Verify it works anytime with:

```bash
python scripts/test_gemini.py
```

Optional overrides (defaults in `config.py` are fine for development):

```dotenv
# LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b
# LLM_REASONING_FORMAT=hidden
# LLM_REASONING_EFFORT=low
# APP_VERSION=0.1.0
# LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# LLM_MAX_TOKENS=1024
# LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.1
# LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30.0
# LLM_MAX_RETRIES=1
# STT_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo
# STT_LANGUAGE=fr
# STT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30.0
# STT_MAX_RETRIES=1
# MAX_AUDIO_UPLOAD_MB=5.0
# GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
# GEMINI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=45.0
# WEATHER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10.0
# SOIL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=12.0
# WEB_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15.0
# FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key_here
# FIRECRAWL_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=45.0
# FIRECRAWL_SCRAPE_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
# FIRECRAWL_MAX_RETRIES=2
# FLASK_DEBUG=true
# PREFER_MARKDOWN_KB=true # use Data/markdown before PDF fallback
# REBUILD_VECTORSTORE=true   # force a fresh index rebuild
```

### 3. Add knowledge documents

Place reviewed Markdown documents under `Data/markdown/`. DakiKobo uses this
Markdown corpus first because it is smaller and cleaner than extracting PDFs at
startup. Keep original Burkina Faso agriculture PDFs anywhere under `Data/` as
source files and as a fallback; subfolders are discovered recursively.

### 4. Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000> in your browser.

> **First run:** DakiKobo builds the vector index from the reviewed Markdown
> corpus and saves it to `chroma_db/`. On CPU this one-time build can take
> several minutes. Subsequent starts load the saved index and are fast. To
> rebuild later (e.g. after adding documents or changing the embedding model),
> start with `REBUILD_VECTORSTORE=true` to replace the saved index.

---

## Usage

- **Ask a question** about Burkina Faso agriculture in French.
- **Quick chips** above the input send common questions in one tap.
- **Voice output:** tick *"Activer la lecture vocale"* to hear answers read aloud.
- **Voice input:** tap the microphone, speak, then tap again to stop or wait for auto-stop.
- **Save a useful answer:** accept the 90-day private-journal notice, then use 👍 / 👎.
  DakiKobo links the saved answer and later field outcome to the exact retrieval decisions.
- **Return later:** **Mes conseils** lists only entries owned by the current anonymous browser
  session. `GET /journal/due` returns that same owner's due digest without question or answer text.
- **Delete:** remove one or every server-side journal entry separately from cached answers and
  preferences stored on the device. Clearing browser cookies loses access to the anonymous journal.

---

## Evaluation

Run a repeatable public demo check against the Hugging Face Space:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_rag.py
```

The script waits for `/healthz`, exercises RAG, fertilizer, weather, soil, and
off-topic safety cases, then writes `reports/rag_eval_results.md`.

The same evaluator is wired into GitHub Actions as
`.github/workflows/hf-smoke.yml`. It can run manually from the Actions tab and
also runs daily on schedule, uploading the Markdown report as an artifact.
The Docker image is checked by `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`, which builds
the Space container and smoke-tests `/healthz` without pushing an image.

Two further workflows exercise acceptance rehearsals in CI:

- `.github/workflows/browser-rehearsal.yml` runs a headless-browser (Chromium)
  rehearsal of the UI at 320 px and 1280 px against a synthetic fixture that
  calls no model or provider, and uploads screenshots and results as artifacts.
  Playwright is a test-only dependency (`requirements-browser.txt`) and is kept
  out of the production requirements. This is headless-browser evidence only, not
  physical-phone or participant testing.
- `.github/workflows/docker-journal-rehearsal.yml` builds the production image and
  runs a bounded synthetic rehearsal proving a private journal saved into a local
  bind mount survives a container replacement. This is local bind-mount
  persistence evidence only, not hosting-provider disk durability or a real
  browser.

Useful options:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_rag.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8005
python scripts/evaluate_rag.py --strict
```

## Offline Source Ingestion

Firecrawl is available for collecting candidate web pages, but scraped output is
not ingested directly. It is written to `Data/scraped/pending/` with source
metadata and a review checklist. URLs are checked against
`Data/scraped/source_allowlist.csv` by default.

Use the first curated FAO Burkina Faso seed batch:

```bash
python scripts/firecrawl_ingest.py --list-seeds
python scripts/firecrawl_ingest.py --seed-batch
```

Scrape a single allowlisted URL:

```bash
python scripts/firecrawl_ingest.py \
  --url https://www.fao.org/in-action/mafap/where-we-work/burkina-faso/en \
  --publisher "Publisher name" \
  --topics "semis, fertilite" \
  --crops "mil, sorgho"
```

For manual experiments outside the allowlist, pass `--allow-unlisted`. Do not
promote those files without adding a reviewed allowlist row first.

After human review and cleanup, promote the pending file into the active Markdown
corpus:

```bash
python scripts/firecrawl_ingest.py \
  --promote Data/scraped/pending/20260702_example_abc12345.md \
  --reviewer your_name
```

Then rebuild the vector store with `REBUILD_VECTORSTORE=true`.

## Configuration reference

All tunables live in `config.py` (overridable via server environment variables
where shown). The web process never loads `.env`; export variables locally or
configure them in the hosting provider's Secrets/Variables panel. Never store a
secret file inside `public_html` or the container build context.

| `IMAGE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `6.0`                                  | Per-session cooldown for image screening |
| `MAX_IMAGE_UPLOAD_MB`  | `5.0`                                    | Maximum uploaded image size (advertised per-file limit, enforced per route) |
| `MULTIPART_OVERHEAD_BYTES` | `524288`                             | Headroom (512 KiB) added to the per-file limit to form Flask's whole-request `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`, so a file at the advertised size is accepted despite multipart boundary/header/field overhead |

Notes on the audio and upload limits:

- **TTS storage is bounded.** Generated MP3s are named after the answer they
  speak, so identical answers reuse one file instead of writing a new one every
  time. `TTS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` drops files by age first; if `static/audio/` is
  still above `TTS_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`, the least-recently-used files are removed
  until it fits. The file being served is never evicted.
- **The upload limit and the transport ceiling are separate.**
  `MAX_IMAGE_UPLOAD_MB` / `MAX_AUDIO_UPLOAD_MB` are the advertised per-file
  limits checked inside each route. Flask's `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` caps the whole
  multipart body and is set to the larger per-file limit **plus**
  `MULTIPART_OVERHEAD_BYTES`, so a file exactly at the documented size is not
  rejected once boundary markers, part headers, and field-context values are
  counted.

## Notes

- `.env`, `chroma_db/`, generated audio, `data/feedback.csv` and
  `data/case_log.sqlite3*` are git-ignored.
- `/healthz` reports readiness; `/version` reports app version, commit if exposed
  by the host, key runtime config flags, and the field-journal schema version.
- Runtime logs are JSON lines with route, status, latency, model/feature, failure
  type and confidence where available. Raw questions, answers, images and audio
  are not logged.
- Leaf photos and voice recordings are used only for the requested analysis or
  transcription. The app warns users not to send faces, names, numbers or
  personal documents.
- This tool gives general guidance; users should confirm specifics (e.g. fertilizer
  doses) with a local agricultural extension agent.

Offline answer replay requires a nonempty `X-DakiKobo-Safety` revision matching
the saved policy marker. Missing, blank, or mismatched revisions are refused;
reconnect to obtain a current sourced answer.

Audio cleanup also removes abandoned partial writes on the next cleanup pass.
It skips symlinks and active writes using POSIX advisory locks (Linux/macOS).
The MP3 size cap excludes active/recent partials and preserves the current
response file; it is not a hard quota for all concurrent temporary writes.
Source-review preparation: [five-crop coverage matrix](Data/reviews/CROP_COVERAGE_MATRIX_2026-09-09.md).

If a saved audio file expires or playback fails, the replay control displays a
French status message and keeps the text advice visible. Users can check their
connection and retry. The browser does not regenerate the deleted recording.
