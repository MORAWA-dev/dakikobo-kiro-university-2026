# DakiKobo — Implementation Plan

Single, merged, de-duplicated backlog built from `models_sugestions/` (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini
sessions 1–2) **plus** a direct read of the source tree. Tasks are ordered **easiest / lowest-risk
first**, hardest / highest-risk last. Each task lists the exact files it touches, a one-line
definition of done a non-developer can verify, and an effort tag: **S** (<60 min), **M** (one
session), **L** (two+ sessions).

Rules of engagement: one task per step, smallest change that works, test before commit, never leave
the app unable to start. Answers, labels, and TTS stay in **French**. Keep everything mobile-friendly.

Status legend: `[ ]` todo · `[x]` done.

---

## Tier 1 — Quick bug & path fixes (do first)

- [x] **1b. Force French answers + French fallback** — `core/llm_chain.py`
  - *Done when:* asking a question (even one phrased in English) returns the answer — and the
    "I don't know" fallback — in French. **(S)**

- [x] **1c. Translate UI strings to French** — `static/js/index.js`, `app.py`
  - *Done when:* the welcome message, the bot self-identity reply (also triggered by French
    phrasing), and the error message all appear in French. **(S)**

- [x] **1. Fix broken avatar + favicon/logo paths** — `static/js/index.js`, `templates/index.html`
  - *Done when:* the page loads with the DakiKobo logo, bot avatar, user avatar, and browser-tab
    icon all visible — no broken-image icons. **(S)**

- [x] **2. Re-encode `requirements.txt` as UTF-8** — `requirements.txt`
  - *Done when:* `file requirements.txt` reports ASCII/UTF-8 text (not "data"), with the same
    package list. **(S)**

- [x] **3. Fix `DATA_FOLDER` casing** — `config.py`
  - *Done when:* `DATA_FOLDER` points at the correctly-cased `Data` tree; startup log shows PDFs
    found recursively (works on Linux/Colab, not just macOS). **(S)**

- [x] **4. Fix TTS truncation** — `config.py`, `core/rag_pipeline.py`
  - *Done when:* enabling audio on a ~90-word French answer plays speech that reaches the end of
    the sentence instead of cutting off mid-word. **(S)**

- [x] **5. Enable the similarity-score threshold** — `core/llm_chain.py`, `config.py`
  - *Done when:* asking an off-topic question (e.g. "comment réparer un moteur de voiture ?")
    returns the "information not available" fallback instead of a confident answer. **(S)**

- [x] **6. Recursive PDF ingestion** — `core/rag_pipeline.py`, `config.py`
  - *Done when:* the startup log prints a higher PDF count than before (subfolders included), and
    one unreadable PDF does not crash startup. **(S)**

- [x] **7. Remove dead files** — delete `chat1.py`, `chat2.py`, `static/css/broken.css`, `static/js/broken.js`
  - *Done when:* those files are gone and `python app.py` still starts normally. **(S)**

---

## Tier 2 — RAG quality & trust (medium)

- [x] **8. Attach source metadata at ingestion** — `core/rag_pipeline.py`, `app.py`
  - *Done when:* a retrieved chunk carries its originating PDF filename in `metadata["source"]`
    (verified by a quick print/check). **(M)**

- [x] **9. Return + render source citations** — `core/retrieval.py`, `app.py`, `static/js/index.js`, `static/css/style.css`
  - *Done when:* under each bot answer the UI shows the document name(s) the answer drew from;
    answers with no retrieved source show none. **(M)**
  - Citation ranking and confidence are isolated from Flask in `core/retrieval.py`; `/ask`
    performs one scored top-six search and passes the same accepted chunks to generation and
    source grading.

- [x] **10. Persistent Chroma vector store** — `config.py`, `core/rag_pipeline.py`, `app.py`
  - *Done when:* the second `python app.py` starts noticeably faster and logs "loading existing
    index" instead of re-embedding (rebuild only when `REBUILD_VECTORSTORE=true`). **(M)**

- [x] **11. Multilingual embeddings upgrade** — `config.py`, `core/rag_pipeline.py` (+ one-time reindex)
  - *Done when:* after rebuilding the index with a multilingual model, the same French question
    returns on-topic source chips while off-topic queries still hit the fallback. **(M)**
  - Switched `EMBEDDING_MODEL` to `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` (chosen over heavier
    multilingual alternatives because it is faster to embed on CPU while still good for French).
  - Switching the model changed the relevance-score scale (Chroma's default L2 produced large
    negative scores → the 0.2 threshold rejected everything). Fixed by setting the Chroma collection
    to **cosine** space (`collection_metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"}`), which normalizes scores so
    the existing `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.2` keeps working across models.
  - Verified end-to-end on the real code path (build → persist → load → threshold retriever):
    on-topic French queries return source docs; off-topic ("moteur de voiture", "capital of France")
    return 0 → fallback. Cosine scores: on-topic top ~0.32–0.53, off-topic top ~0.03–0.11.
  - **Requires a one-time reindex:** no `chroma_db/` existed, so the next `python app.py` builds fresh
    with the new model (slower first build on CPU, then fast loads via the Task 10 persistence). If a
    stale index ever exists after a future model change, delete `chroma_db/` or set
    `REBUILD_VECTORSTORE=true`.

- [x] **11b. Markdown-first knowledge ingestion** — `config.py`, `core/rag_pipeline.py`, `app.py`
  - *Done when:* startup loads reviewed documents from `Data/markdown/` by default, keeps source
    metadata back to the original PDFs, and falls back to recursive PDF extraction only when
    Markdown is missing or `PREFER_MARKDOWN_KB=false`. **(S)**
  - Added a dependency-free Markdown frontmatter parser and loader. Converted documents carry
    `source`, `source_file`, `markdown_file`, `data_format`, `doc_type`, `language`, and page-count
    metadata where available.
  - The converted corpus audit now passes for 16/16 PDFs; the formerly deferred
    `Caractéristiques des ménages agricoles...` file was regenerated from its PDF.
  - **Requires a one-time reindex:** set `REBUILD_VECTORSTORE=true` so the persisted Chroma store
    is cleared and rebuilt from Markdown instead of the previous PDF extraction.

---

## Tier 3 — Mobile UX (medium)

- [x] **12. Mobile-first responsive layout** — `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`
  - *Done when:* at 360px width (Chrome device toolbar) the chat fills the screen, the input bar
    is pinned to the bottom, and there is no horizontal scroll. **(M)**
  - Added global `box-sizing: border-box` so padding can't cause overflow; made `.chat-container`
    responsive (`max-width: 100%`, `max-height: 100%`) and switched body height to `100dvh` for
    correct sizing under mobile browser chrome.
  - Added a `@media (max-width: 480px)` block: container goes full-screen (`width: 100%`,
    `height: 100dvh`, square corners), tightened header/messages/input/footer padding, widened
    message bubbles to 90%, and let the footer wrap so the clear button + voice toggle never overflow.
  - Input bar stays pinned to the bottom via the existing flex column (`.chat-messages { flex: 1 }`)
    now that the container fills the viewport height. Long source filenames already wrap
    (`word-break`), so no horizontal scroll at 360px.
  - Also set `<html lang="fr">` (was `en`) to match the app's French UI.

- [x] **13. Quick-action chips + active mic state** — `templates/index.html`, `static/js/index.js`, `static/css/style.css`
  - *Done when:* tapping a French chip (e.g. "Semis du mil") sends that question and gets an
    answer, and the mic button visibly pulses while listening. **(M)**
  - Added a horizontal, scrollable `.quick-chips` row above the input with 5 French crop chips
    (Semis du mil, Fertiliser le sorgho, Maladies du niébé, Culture du maïs, Rotation des cultures);
    each carries the full question in `data-question`.
  - JS delegates `.chip` clicks: sets `#messageText` to the question and calls `sendMessage()`
    (guarded by `isProcessing`).
  - Mic button now pulses while listening: `recognition.onstart` adds a `.listening` class
    (red pulsing `box-shadow` animation), `onend`/error removes it. Also localized the STT failure
    alert to French.

- [x] **14. Feedback capture (👍 / 👎)** — `app.py`, `static/js/index.js`, `static/css/style.css`
  - *Done when:* clicking 👎 under an answer appends a new row to `data/feedback.csv`
    (no database). **(M)**
  - Added a `POST /feedback` route that appends `timestamp,rating,question,answer` to
    `data/feedback.csv` (creates the file + header on first write; validates rating ∈ {up,down}).
  - Frontend renders 👍/👎 buttons under each bot answer (after typing); clicking posts the
    rating with the originating question + answer, disables the buttons, and shows "Merci !".
  - Verified with Flask's test client: invalid rating → 400; up/down → rows appended with header.
  - Added `data/feedback.csv` to `.gitignore` (runtime-generated, not committed).

---

## Tier 4 — Docs & tests (medium, low-risk)

- [x] **15. Rewrite `README.md`** — `README.md`
  - *Done when:* the README matches the current stack (Flask, Groq `llama-3.3-70b`, LangChain,
    Chroma, French TTS), uses server-level environment variables for the web process, and contains
    no instruction to put API keys in source or the served webroot. **(M)**
  - Full rewrite: accurate stack (Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, multilingual MiniLM embeddings,
    persistent Chroma), local shell/server environment setup workflow, features list
    (sources, TTS/STT, quick chips, feedback, mobile UI), config reference table, project layout,
    and a first-run/rebuild note. Removed the old insecure "put your key in chat2.py" instruction
    and the stale Mixtral references.

- [x] **16. First pytest smoke tests** — `tests/`
  - *Done when:* `pytest` passes tests asserting ingestion finds the expected Markdown/PDF source
    files and a known French crop question returns a non-empty answer. **(S)**
  - `tests/test_ingestion.py`: asserts expected Markdown files are discoverable under
    `Data/markdown/`, expected PDFs remain available under `Data/`, and both loaders return
    non-empty `Document`s with source metadata.
  - `tests/test_rag.py`: live smoke test — builds a tiny in-memory Chroma (cosine), runs the
    real `RetrievalQA` chain on "Quand semer le mil ?", asserts a non-empty answer. Auto-skips
    when `GROQ_API_KEY` is unset (so CI without a key still passes).
  - Added `pytest` to `requirements.txt` and `.pytest_cache/` to `.gitignore`.
  - Result: `3 passed` (all three ran locally with the `.env` key present).

---

## Tier 5 — New modules (hardest / highest-risk, do last)

- [x] **17. Deterministic fertilizer tool + keyword branch** — `core/fertilizer.py`, `app.py`
  - *Done when:* asking "dose d'engrais pour le sorgho" returns a specific source-grounded dose
    with a French "confirmez avec votre agent" disclaimer (no invented numbers). **(L)**
  - **Data check first:** the existing PDF corpus has NO per-crop dose tables (its `kg/ha` figures
    are yields, plus one anecdotal maize line; `farmer_training_manual.pdf` is a generic India-
    oriented handbook). So doses were sourced from **published Burkina/INERA research** (verified
    via web search) rather than invented or pulled from anecdotes.
  - `core/fertilizer.py`: fixed, cited per-crop doses for sorgho, mil, maïs, niébé, arachide
    (e.g. cereals = 100 kg/ha NPK 14-23-14 + 50 kg/ha urée; maïs = 150 + 100; niébé = 100 NPK only;
    arachide = légumineuse, ~14 kg N/ha + fumure organique). Includes microdose alternatives for
    cereals. Every answer carries the "Confirmez toujours avec votre agent agricole" disclaimer and
    cites its source(s). `is_fertilizer_query()` detects intent; `get_fertilizer_advice()` returns
    `None` (→ RAG) when no supported crop is named.
  - `app.py`: deterministic keyword branch in `/ask` runs before the LLM, so fertilizer questions
    get grounded numbers (with TTS + source chips) and never hit the model's invention risk.
  - Added `tests/test_fertilizer.py` (4 tests, no network): intent detection, grounded sorgho dose
    + disclaimer, all 5 crops covered, and deferral to RAG when no crop is named. All pass.
  - **September 2026 safety correction:** deterministic routing remains active, but every exact
    numeric recommendation is withheld online and offline until the F6 agronomist provenance gate is
    satisfied. Ambiguous multi-crop and unsupported-crop requests refuse or ask for clarification.

- [x] **18. Intent router** — `core/router.py`, `app.py`
  - *Done when:* fertilizer questions hit the fertilizer tool, everything else hits RAG, and
    normal Q&A is unchanged. **(M)**
  - `core/router.py`: `classify(query)` returns `INTENT_FERTILIZER` only when the question is a
    fertilizer query AND names a supported crop; otherwise `INTENT_RAG`. Centralizes dispatch so a
    future "disease" intent can be added without touching the route.
  - `app.py`: `/ask` now dispatches via `classify()` (replacing the inline keyword branch). The RAG
    path is untouched, so normal Q&A behaves exactly as before.
  - Added `tests/test_router.py` (3 tests): fertilizer+crop → tool, fertilizer-without-crop → RAG,
    normal/other questions → RAG. All pass.

- [x] **19. Disease screening via Gemini Vision + image upload** — `core/disease.py`, `app.py`, `templates/index.html`, `static/js/index.js`
  - *Done when:* uploading a leaf photo returns a hedged French screening with a "ceci n'est pas
    un diagnostic" disclaimer, and a blurry/random photo returns a polite "je ne peux pas dire,
    reprenez la photo". **(L)**
  - `core/disease.py`: calls Gemini Vision via the **REST API using `requests`** (no SDK dependency —
    the `google-genai` install tried to compile a Rust wheel and hung). Prompt forces a hedged French
    screening ("il pourrait s'agir de…") and returns a sentinel for unusable photos → polite
    "reprenez la photo" message. Code guarantees the "Ceci n'est pas un diagnostic" disclaimer, and
    gracefully handles missing key / network errors / 429 quota.
  - `config.py`: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`).
  - `app.py`: `POST /screen` accepts an uploaded image, returns French screening + TTS.
  - UI: camera button in the input bar (`accept="image/*" capture="environment"`), JS shows the
    user's photo bubble, posts multipart to `/screen`, renders the answer (with optional voice).
  - Added `scripts/test_gemini.py` — reusable key checker (`python scripts/test_gemini.py`).
  - Tests: `tests/test_disease.py` (5, HTTP mocked) cover unclear photo, disclaimer append/no-dup,
    429, and missing-key paths. Live wiring confirmed end-to-end (reached Gemini; returned the
    friendly 429 message).
  - **Live confirmed working:** the earlier 429 was model-specific — `gemini-2.0-flash` had no free
    quota, but `gemini-2.5-flash` works. Default model switched to `gemini-2.5-flash`; a live vision
    call returned the correct "unclear photo" response for a blank image. `scripts/test_gemini.py`
    now tests the app's configured model and reports ✅.

- [x] **20. Public demo guardrails** — `config.py`, `app.py`, `tests/test_app_routes.py`
  - *Done when:* repeated expensive requests are slowed per session, oversized image uploads are
    rejected before Gemini, and users receive clear French errors. **(S)**
  - `config.py`: added `REQUEST_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` (2s), `IMAGE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` (6s), and
    `MAX_IMAGE_UPLOAD_MB` (5 MB), all overridable via environment variables.
  - `app.py`: `/ask` and `/screen` now return HTTP 429 with `retry_after` for rapid repeats; image
    uploads over the configured limit return HTTP 413 before vision processing.
  - Tests cover text cooldown, image cooldown, and oversized upload responses.

- [x] **21. Quota-safe public examples** — `core/examples.py`, `app.py`, `templates/index.html`, `static/js/index.js`
  - *Done when:* visitors can run 3 text examples, 1 fertilizer example, and 1 image-case example
    without invoking Groq, Gemini, or TTS. **(S)**
  - Added `/examples/<example_id>` with canned French demo responses using the same `answer`,
    `sources`, `confidence`, and `case` JSON shape as live routes.
  - Replaced quick chips with a compact examples panel that renders normal answers and case cards
    through the existing chat UI.
  - Tests cover text, fertilizer, image-case, missing-example, and index markup paths.

- [x] **22. Weather-aware advice card** — `core/weather.py`, `app.py`, `templates/index.html`, `static/js/index.js`
  - *Done when:* users can choose a Burkina Faso location and see a compact weather card with
    rainfall, ET0, soil moisture signal, sowing-window guidance, and urea-before-rain warning. **(M)**
  - `core/weather.py`: uses Open-Meteo forecast data for selected locations, derives four cautious
    agronomic signals, and caches responses by location/date to protect the free Space.
  - `app.py`: added `/weather/locations` and `/weather`, returning structured weather JSON plus
    French error responses.
  - UI: added a `Météo agricole` selector and a compact card renderer instead of a long paragraph.
  - Tests cover API parsing/cache behavior, route success/failure paths, and page markup.

- [x] **23. Soil-aware fertilizer context** — `core/soil.py`, `app.py`, `templates/index.html`, `static/js/index.js`
  - *Done when:* users can choose crop + location and see SoilGrids-derived explanatory indicators
    beside deterministic fertilizer guidance, with clear soil-test confirmation language. **(M)**
  - `core/soil.py`: queries SoilGrids for clay, sand, organic carbon, pH, and CEC at 0-5 cm; converts
    them into classes for texture tendency, organic carbon, pH, and nutrient-retention risk.
  - `app.py`: added `/soil/locations` and `/soil`; `/soil` combines the soil context with the existing
    deterministic fertilizer tool rather than asking the LLM for doses.
  - UI: added a `Sol + engrais` selector and compact card renderer with metrics, indicators,
    fertilizer text, source cards, and the required local-test disclaimer.
  - Tests cover SoilGrids parsing/cache behavior, route success/failure paths, and page markup.

- [x] **24. TTS timeout fallback** — `config.py`, `core/rag_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_tts.py`
  - *Done when:* a slow or failing gTTS request returns the answer with `audio_url: ""` instead of
    blocking the Flask worker. **(S)**
  - `config.py`: added `TTS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 8s).
  - `core/rag_pipeline.py`: passes the timeout to `gTTS` and treats audio generation as optional.
  - Tests cover timeout propagation, failure fallback, and sentence-boundary truncation.

- [x] **25. Credible mobile UX pass** — `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, `static/js/index.js`
  - *Done when:* the first screen prioritizes the conversation, tools are available without crowding
    the chat, and icon controls are understandable on phones. **(S)**
  - Moved weather and soil selectors behind one `Outils` drawer beside the input.
  - Replaced the cartoon bot avatar with the neutral DakiKobo logo in all bot messages.
  - Added compact wrapped examples, higher-contrast section labels, and clearer labels/tooltips for
    send, voice input, image screening, and tools.
  - Tests cover the index markup hooks for the drawer and existing tool controls.

- [x] **26. Per-answer audio replay** — `static/js/index.js`, `static/css/style.css`
  - *Done when:* generated audio can be replayed from its answer bubble, while the footer checkbox
    remains the single global auto-play toggle. **(S)**
  - Added a `Réécouter` button for normal RAG answers and image screening answers when `audio_url`
    is present.
  - Centralized browser audio playback so starting a new answer stops the previous audio, and turning
    off the global voice checkbox stops current playback.

- [x] **27. Sources and limits panel** — `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, `static/js/index.js`
  - *Done when:* reviewers can inspect what evidence the app uses, what remains approximate, and
    where human confirmation is required without crowding the chat. **(S)**
  - Added a header `Sources` control that opens a compact `Sources & limites` dialog.
  - Summarizes local RAG documents, deterministic fertilizer logic, Open-Meteo/SoilGrids signals,
    and field-confirmation limits in French.
  - Tests cover the modal markup and frontend wiring.

- [x] **28. Hosted RAG warm-up** — `app.py`, `config.py`, `Dockerfile`
  - *Done when:* the Hugging Face container starts preparing RAG in the background instead of waiting
    for the first reviewer question to trigger the slow path. **(S)**
  - Added `RAG_WARMUP_ON_START` (default off locally) and enabled it in the Docker image for Spaces.
  - `/healthz` now reports `rag_status` and warm-up timestamps/errors while keeping `rag_ready`.
  - Tests cover the one-shot background warm-up trigger without loading models.

- [x] **29. Phase 3 cache and concurrency** — `core/cache.py`, `core/answer_cache.py`, `core/ops_metrics.py`, `app.py`, `Dockerfile`
  - Added a WAL-enabled SQLite TTL cache with 30-second connection timeouts and namespace isolation.
  - Moved weather (until local midnight), soil (30 days), and privacy-safe ops events out of
    process-local dictionaries so workers share one coherent state boundary.
  - Added a 24-hour answer cache keyed by normalized question, canonical crop/place ids, growth
    stage, Français simple mode, model, and active corpus-manifest hash. Cache hits bypass routing,
    Groq, retrieval, weather, and TTS while retaining grounded sources and chunk provenance.
  - Added the salted question-hash helper for the Phase 4 evidence ledger and guarded case-log
    schema initialization once per process/database path.
  - Serialized Chroma initialization with a process-safe file lock after the two-worker live smoke
    exposed a concurrent `collections_tmp` migration race.
  - Pruned unused direct dependencies, pinned NumPy/Torch/Transformers, and raised production
    serving to two workers × four threads with a 90-second request timeout.
  - Tests cover TTL expiry/purge, WAL concurrency, cache-key invalidation, router bypass, privacy,
    and cross-worker ops percentiles.
  - Hosted warm-up was later measured at 190 seconds (16:34:14–16:37:24 UTC) versus the earlier
    roughly four-minute operational baseline recorded in `SESSION.md`, about 21% shorter.

- [x] **30. Phase 4 field journal and evidence ledger** — `core/case_log.py`, `core/retrieval.py`, `app.py`
  - Migrated the case log additively to schema v4 with crop/place ids, answer path, seven-day
    follow-up due time, and a WAL-enabled evidence ledger.
  - `/ask` records every kept and dropped retrieval chunk with exact score and the stable
    `weak_title`, `low_overlap`, or `score_margin` decision. `/feedback` links that batch using a
    salted question hash and exact response reference; cache hits clone the original decisions.
  - Added the privacy-minimized `/journal/due` digest and joined chunk decisions into the private
    CSV/JSONL feedback export.
  - Extracted the shared field-case contract and replaced demo-specific case hardcoding, removing
    the late circular-import workaround.
  - Added an offline JSON golden set and migration, privacy, best-effort, two-step linkage, due-case,
    and export regression tests. No Groq or network access is required.

- [x] **31. Phase 5 offline-first shell and frontend modules** — `static/sw.js`, `static/js/api.js`, `static/js/render.js`
  - Added an installable PWA shell with root-scoped service worker, cache-first app/registry/example
    assets, and network-first `/ask` responses with exact cached-answer fallback.
  - Mirrored the authoritative deterministic fertilizer table into a precached JSON asset, guarded
    by a checked-in generator and parity test, so supported fertilizer questions and every canonical
    crop alias remain available without a signal.
  - Added the French offline status banner and a cautious offline refusal for uncached non-fertilizer
    questions rather than fabricating an answer.
  - Split rendering and network requests into focused browser modules while preserving the existing
    follow-up context, photo question, registry ids, and event behavior.
  - Added `node --test` + jsdom regressions for display-text filtering, safe typed text, and the
    six-argument photo upload contract. Behavioral worker tests cover offline fertilizer aliases and
    ensure only the explicit shell is cached; weather, health, ops, version, and journal GETs remain live.

- [x] **32. Farmer-safety engineering baseline** — September 2026 follow-up plan
  - The journal's schema-v5 migration introduced anonymous browser ownership, explicit consent,
    90-day expiry, idempotent saves, owned reads/writes/deletion, attachment re-encoding, and
    research-export consent filtering. Schema v5 is now a superseded historical intermediate;
    the current additive schema is **v6**, which persists and replays saved source cards and their
    declared scope. Legacy unowned rows remain operator-only, and rows without saved sources remain
    readable without reconstructing historical citations.
  - Aligned offline crop precedence with the server, rejected ambiguous/unsupported crop requests,
    added cache age/corpus checks, excluded dynamic context from answer caching, and made chat reset
    clear the prior-question state and active playback.
  - Made source ingestion fail closed on explicit owner/agronomist review, removed startup web
    ingestion, inventoried current candidates, withheld all unverified numeric fertilizer guidance,
    and strengthened mandatory evaluator contracts.
  - Added farmer task starters, default simple French, immediate answer rendering, transcript review,
    photo resizing, local jQuery, offline-readiness messaging, private journal controls, shared
    cross-worker request budgets, and complete PR regression gates.
  - Local gate: 288 Python tests and 12 JavaScript tests pass; compilation, generated-asset stability,
    diff checks, blank-scorecard rejection, and an isolated runtime journal smoke pass.
  - **Release remains blocked** on agronomist source/dose review, real-phone accessibility/usability
    checks, the farmer/extension-agent pilot, production persistence verification, and live RAG
    evaluation after the intentionally stricter eligible-source rebuild.

- [x] **33. Answer-safety audit repairs** — `core/answer_safety.py`, `core/disease.py`, `app.py`, `core/answer_cache.py`, `core/rag_pipeline.py`, `config.py`, `static/sw.js`
  - Validate Gemini Vision JSON before use: a non-object payload is rejected instead of crashing,
    wrongly typed fields are normalized, and vision confidence is clamped to `Faible`/`Moyen`
    (`Fort` unreachable).
  - Enforce, not just prompt, the advice ban: model-generated pesticide names, chemical doses, and
    definitive diagnoses are removed from both the vision path and the grounded RAG answer, with a
    French redaction notice and a deterministic refusal when nothing safe survives. `a_confirmer_par`
    is replaced by the agent-confirmation fallback when unsafe, malformed, empty, or not
    agent-directed. Pesticide names match on normalized token/phrase boundaries so "décision" no
    longer collides with the trade name "Decis"; a quantity is a dose only with chemical context, so
    irrigation/seed/spacing/compost/yield figures survive.
  - Exact fertilizer doses stay out of the model path entirely; agronomist-approved figures remain
    restricted to the deterministic `core/fertilizer` module (`NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED` unchanged).
  - Bind both answer caches to a safety/prompt revision, run the answer-cache lookup only after
    safety-sensitive intent classification, refuse before the LLM when retrieval accepts zero
    documents, and return 503/502/429 for genuine RAG/vision failures with the French JSON contract
    intact.
  - Configuration added, all env-overridable and documented in `README.md`:
    - `TTS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default `86400`) — max age of a generated MP3 in `static/audio/`
      before pruning; `0` disables age-based pruning.
    - `TTS_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` (default `67108864`) — total size cap for `static/audio/`; the
      least-recently-used MP3s are removed until it fits; `0` disables size-based pruning.
    - `MULTIPART_OVERHEAD_BYTES` (default `524288`) — headroom added to the advertised per-file
      upload limit to form Flask's whole-request `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`, so a file at the documented
      size is accepted despite multipart boundary/header/field overhead.
  - Generated MP3 filenames now hash the spoken text (identical answers reuse one file), writes are
    atomic, and the audio directory is bounded by the two TTS cache settings above.
  - Regression tests cover every finding, including diagnosis in a RAG answer, unsafe content in
    `a_confirmer_par`, "20 litres d'eau par pied" staying unchanged, and "La décision dépend de la
    pluie" staying unchanged. Each new test was confirmed to fail against the unmodified sources.

## Later / parked (do **not** attempt now)

- **Custom disease CNN training** — no field-validated Burkina dataset; PlantVillage models collapse
  on real phone photos. Better as an honest Colab "domain-shift" research artifact.
- **Real yield-prediction model** — needs local plot-level data; false precision harms trust. Keep
  to a clearly-labeled reference range or a research notebook.
- **Native mobile app (Flutter/Android)** — months of work; the responsive web app covers the demo.
- **Offline / edge inference (local LLM)** — out of scope for the deadline and the hardware.
- **Local-language generation (Mooré / Dioula / Fulfuldé)** — a research project, not a feature;
  French first.
- **Firebase / user accounts / admin dashboard** — unnecessary backend complexity for v1.

*Conflicts resolved by reading the code: embeddings → `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`
(lighter than `bge-m3` for a laptop on a 3-week timeline); persist dir → `chroma_db/` (already
git-ignored); Gemini's session-2 source-chip JS diff has a string-concatenation bug, so task 9 is
hand-written rather than pasted.*

- [x] **Plan 2026-09-09, ticket 03 — missing offline policy identity:** require a
  nonempty safety revision before saving or replaying an answer. Regression
  coverage includes absent, empty and whitespace headers and legacy stored
  entries with an empty marker. Full real-browser migration acceptance remains open.

- [x] **Plan ticket 06 — abandoned audio fragments:** configurable
  `TTS_PARTIAL_TTL_SECONDS=3600`; prune old generated partials only when unlocked,
  skip symlinks, hold a POSIX advisory lock through synthesis and atomic rename.
  Recent and unrelated files are preserved. MP3 budget semantics are unchanged.
- [x] **Plan ticket 03 — worker activation regression:** old-version answer cache
  removal followed by offline refusal tested with shared simulated cache storage.
  Real-phone/browser lifecycle verification remains open.
- [x] **Plan ticket 05 — review preparation:** five-crop × four-topic matrix in
  `Data/reviews/CROP_COVERAGE_MATRIX_2026-09-09.md`. Original IITA and ProSol PDF
  pages and document hashes are recorded. Specialist approval, ingestion and
  measured post-review coverage remain open.

- [x] **Plan ticket 06 — expired audio replay:** visible French live status on
  playback rejection/media error; text preserved and retry clears the message.
  Full chat UI tested with jsdom and a simulated Audio boundary.
- [x] **Plan ticket 07 — synthetic recovery rehearsal prepared:** separate Flask
  processes, stable test secret, owner/other-client isolation, SQLite backup and
  isolated restore, deletion/expiry checks in `tests/test_recovery.py`.
  DEPLOYMENT.md documents durable paths, WAL-safe backup and rollback. Actual
  host persistence and photo restoration remain release checks.
- [x] **Plan tickets 06–08 — local acceptance expansion:** synthetic journal
  photos survive an isolated same-path snapshot restore and are removed by owner
  deletion or expiry; concurrent audio writes publish only complete files and
  converge to the configured soft budget after writers finish. A headless Chromium
  check at 320 px and 1280 px confirms visible replay recovery, preserved text,
  no horizontal overflow and no page errors. Physical-device and participant
  testing remain open.
- [x] **Weather midnight regression:** use the provider response date for recent
  and forecast windows, falling back to Burkina time. This prevents a host/provider
  date boundary from shifting rainfall totals by one day.
- [x] **Plan ticket 08 — local keyboard preparation:** added a skip link and main
  landmark, distinct accessible names for soil selectors, dialog semantics and
  focus containment for Sources and Mes conseils, Escape dismissal with focus
  restoration, and focus styling for links and text areas. Verified through the
  rendered accessibility tree and keyboard interaction at 320 px. Physical-phone,
  screen-reader and participant acceptance remain open.
- [x] **Plan ticket 08 — microphone-denial regression:** a browser permission
  rejection preserves the existing typed question, leaves manual input enabled
  and gives an explicit French keyboard fallback alongside permission guidance.
  Physical-device permission UI remains open.
- [x] **Plan ticket 09 — evaluation-gate preparation:** development and held-out
  scorecards can be generated separately. Added strict claim-level and anonymous
  participant/task ledgers with explicit 90% and 80% denominators, completeness
  checks and a release-decision template that defaults to postponed. Human review,
  authorized live-model execution and the pilot remain open.


- [x] **Plan ticket 05 (display portion) — source scope in cards and saved
  journal (PR #7, merged):** reviewed source `scope` metadata now propagates from
  ingestion through retrieval to the `/ask` response, the field-case card, the
  answer cache, and offline replay, and is shown in source cards under the French
  label "Portée et limites" (inserted as text, so HTML-like scope cannot execute;
  absent scope is omitted, never inferred). The private field journal was migrated
  additively from schema v5 to **schema v6** (`core/case_log.py`,
  `SCHEMA_VERSION = 6`, additive nullable `sources` column): saved cases persist
  their source cards including `scope` and replay them when reopened. Legacy rows
  without stored sources remain readable and replay as no sources; historical
  sources are never reconstructed. Malformed or oversized source payloads are
  rejected at the `/feedback` boundary with the stable French message
  « Les sources du conseil sont invalides. » (no internal validator text leaks).
  Agronomist source approval and dose enablement remain open (unchanged;
  `NUMERIC_GUIDANCE_VERIFIED` still `False`).
- [x] **Plan ticket 08 (automation portion) — headless-browser rehearsal in CI
  (PR #8, merged):** `tests/browser_replay_check.py` is a reproducible runner that
  starts its synthetic fixture, checks keyboard navigation, modal focus/Escape,
  320 px overflow and audio-failure recovery at 320 px and 1280 px, and on failure
  captures a screenshot and structured `error.json` before teardown; each run
  writes to its own artifact directory. Playwright is a test-only dependency
  (`requirements-browser.txt`), kept out of production `requirements.txt`. The
  `.github/workflows/browser-rehearsal.yml` job (**chromium-rehearsal**) installs
  Chromium, runs the rehearsal, proves it detects injected-assertion and
  fixture-startup failures, and uploads artifacts. This is headless-browser
  evidence only; physical-phone, screen-reader and participant acceptance remain
  open.
- [x] **Plan ticket 07 (automation portion) — Docker journal continuity
  rehearsal (PR #9, merged):** `tests/docker_journal_rehearsal.py` runs the
  production image on an isolated bind mount at `/data/dakikobo`
  (`APP_ENV=production`, Secure cookie kept intact via a test-only cookie-aware
  harness), saves one consented synthetic case, replaces the container from the
  same image/secret/mount, and verifies owner survival, other-client exclusion,
  a non-owner delete returning `deleted: 0`, owner deletion, and a fresh-mount
  negative control. Container names are unique per run; cleanup removes each
  container independently, inspects the `docker rm -f` exit code, and reports
  (never silently ignores) removal and workspace-deletion failures. The
  `.github/workflows/docker-journal-rehearsal.yml` job (**journal-continuity**)
  builds the image and runs the rehearsal. This is **local bind-mount persistence
  evidence only** — hosting-provider disk durability, host rebuild/volume
  migration, and physical-browser evidence remain open, as do production
  persistence verification and live RAG evaluation.

## Integration status — 2026-09-20

- K1 review packet, K2 split-isolated evaluation and reproducible decision scaffold,
  L1 evidence index and L2 physical-phone worksheet are integrated.
- K3 provider-neutral procedure is prepared in
  [HOSTING_VALIDATION.md](evaluation/HOSTING_VALIDATION.md); actual provider
  durability and restore evidence remain pending. Existing automated fixture
  and Docker modes remain the local checks.
- K4/L4 reconcile current versus historical status and repair relative plan links.
  L3 static French UI audit is recorded in
  [the dated report](reports/FRENCH_UI_TEXT_AUDIT_2026-09-20.md).
- Source approvals, numeric doses, physical-phone results and pilot outcomes
  are unchanged. Field release remains REPORTÉE pending those human gates.
